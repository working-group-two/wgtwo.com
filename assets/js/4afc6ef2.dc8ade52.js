Those with a subscription from a WG2 powered mobile operator will soon enjoy a much richer set of features, and will be able to personalize their subscription with products from a marketplace. We will make this happen by letting developers create products that people love, and by helping operators distribute these products to their subscribers.<br><br>In other words, we are creating a product ecosystem, similar to the Apple Appstore and Google Play Store, but the apps in our ecosystem live in the cloud and act upon the mobile subscriptions themselves, rather than live and act on the phone that the subscription uses.<br><br><strong>THE POSITION</strong><br><br><p>You\u2019re not afraid to get your hands dirty! You will be making both public and internal APIs, backend services, as well as architectural decisions. You will also help set up and maintain the required infrastructure for our products. You won\u2019t be alone though, we already have several team members who are very familiar with these things, so you will get a lot of help easing into the role.</p><p>At WG2 we don\u2019t have a dedicated operations team, so parts of what you will be doing may be described as a devops job. All our services run in Kubernetes hosted at AWS, so you won\u2019t need to touch actual hardware. We don\u2019t expect you to be a Kubernetes expert, as long as you\u2019re interested and willing to learn.</p><p>We\u2019re a relatively small team where team members are expected to raise their opinion and make decisions, so you will make a real impact on the direction we\u2019re going.</p><p>Most of our day to day work involves the following technology: Rest, gRPC, Javalin, Jetty, Kotlin, jOOQ, OpenID, Envoy, NATS, K8S, and AWS. You don\u2019t have to know everything from REST to AWS. Maybe you\u2019ve worked with Spring or Jersey instead of Javalin, maybe you\u2019re familiar with Tomcat but not Jetty? Picking up Kotlin should be doable if you know Java or C#. It\u2019s not expected that you know our entire stack before you join, as long as you\u2019re willing to learn (the stack might also change).

We are a remote-friendly and distributed team with most members located in Trondheim, Norway. All current members are within one hour of the CET time zone (UK, Denmark, France). For better team dynamics we believe that the person we hire also should live within the same time zone.</p><p>We do daily morning stand-ups, retros every other week, and backlog grooming when necessary.
