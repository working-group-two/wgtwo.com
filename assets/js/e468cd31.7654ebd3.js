Those with a subscription from a WG2 powered mobile operator will soon enjoy a much richer set of features, and will be able to personalize their subscription with products from a marketplace. We will make this happen by letting developers create products that people love, and by helping operators distribute these products to their subscribers.<br><br>In other words, we are creating a product ecosystem, similar to the Apple Appstore and Google Play Store, but the apps in our ecosystem live in the cloud and act upon the mobile subscriptions themselves, rather than live and act on the phone that the subscription uses.</p><br><p><strong>THE POSITION</strong></p><p>We want to build a Customer Portal. We\u2019re setting up a new team for this purpose, and we\u2019re looking for a full-stack developer who has experience with working on products to join this team. Since the Customer Portal has not been developed yet, you will have the opportunity to be involved from the very start, in a product that plays a critical role in the company.</p><p>Most of our day to day work involves the following technology: Vuetify, Vue, Rest, gRPC, Javalin, Jetty, Kotlin, jOOQ, OpenID, Envoy, NATS, K8S, and AWS. You don\u2019t have to know everything from REST to AWS. Maybe you\u2019ve worked with Spring or Jersey instead of Javalin, maybe you\u2019re familiar with Tomcat but not Jetty? Picking up Kotlin should be doable if you know Java or C#. It\u2019s not expected that you know our entire stack before you join, as long as you\u2019re willing to learn (the stack might also change). We do, however, expect you to have some web backend and database experience, and we expect you to work hard to familiarize yourself with our stack and our projects.</p><br><p><strong>THE PRODUCT TEAM&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>The team today consists of eight engineers, a product designer, a UX researcher, and a product manager, building and developing our ecosystem infrastructure and UI services. We are a remote-friendly and distributed team with most members located in Trondheim, Norway. All current members are within one hour of the CET time zone (UK, Denmark, France). For better team dynamics we believe that the person we hire also should live within the same time zone.</p><p>We do daily morning stand-ups, retros every other week, and backlog grooming when necessary. And that\u2019s it! We\u2019re open to adjusting the way we work if you have any suggestions that you think could make it better.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n                            </value>\\n                        ","\\n                            <name>Our company culture</name>\\n                            <value>\\n\\n                                <p><br></p><p>We\u2019re a challenger in a well established multi-billion dollar industry. To succeed as a company, we need to deliver the high quality core services that subscribers are used to, while also adding value though the way that we operate. We believe our people and our culture will be a key differentiator in achieving this.</p><p>If you join us, you\u2019ll get the trust and freedom needed to make a big impact in the telco industry. Since we\u2019re solving telco problems in a modern way, we recruit from various industries. We have peoplethat used to work at unknown startups, large tech companies like Google, Spotify, and AWS, as well as telecoms like Telenor. We promise that you\u2019ll be surrounded by friendly, motivated and highly skilled coworkers. We have a culture of transparency and openness, and oftentimes we call ourselves a \u201cstart-up for grown-ups\u201d. We know where we\u2019re going, and with a lot of trust in each other, we\u2019ll pave the way there together!</p>We\u2019re a distributed company with offices in Oslo, Trondheim and Stockholm, hubs in Germany and Japan, as well as some remote colleagues in other locations (a total of 13 countries). We\u2019ll pay for your phone, internet and equipment, as well as your lunch and office snacks. We\u2019ll even pay you for your work! The Covid-19 pandemic forced a lot of companies to change how they think, but for us it confirmed that our remote-friendly and transparent approach goes a long way. We frequently host company wide activities online, like tech talks and demos. The whole company also meets up once or twice per year, and smaller groups meet more often. We also have Monday-kick offs and online gaming groups to keep the workday fun.<br><br><p><strong>WHAT\u2019S NEXT?</strong></p><p>If you\u2019re interested in working with us, please apply through the link below, or contact Marietta for any questions on marietta@wgtwo.com.
