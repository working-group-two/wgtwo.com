        Mobile Network Operators face the challenge of scalability on a daily
        basis. Highly complex networks that limit the number of use-cases and
        additional complexity they can take on is the norm.

        Mobile virtual operators of every kind face similar challenges. It is
        hard and expensive to build and operate your own core, and even harder
        to get a competitive advantage from it. A better way is now possible.

        Especially smaller operators are often overwhelmed by the complexity of
        getting even the basic services to work at an affordable cost. Getting
        VoLTE to work, having a call forked to a watch and a smartphone,
        home-routing of SMS, integrating with a lawful intercept solution,
        handling CS fallback, restricting the speed of a data connection,
        handling roaming, and integrating a PBX are examples of basic
        functionality that is complex to produce in a traditional network.

        factories that want their employees to be able to use their normal
        devices, and greenfield MNOs that want a bridge to a national network â€“

        Private networks are a booming part of telecom. Use cases related to
        latency, security, and stability drive demand for smaller mobile
        networks. However, mobile networks are complex to manage. According to a
        study made by Omdia 9 out of 10 enterprises are looking for someone to
        partner with in managing these networks.
