                We are challenging the telecom industry to take a giant step
                into the future. Mobile connectivity has existed for decades,
                has billions of subscribers and &gt;1000 operators around the
                world. It is a well-financed and profitable industry that
                societies fundamentally depend on. But it is not growing. It is
                not innovating. And it leaves value on the table for other
                industries to Leverage.
              </p>

              <p>
                The pace of innovation and investment from adjacent industries,
                be it hyperscalers, device manufacturers or content providers is
                different - and drives higher performance.
              </p>

              <p>
                Instead of being constantly challenged by the technology and
                operating model choices of these tech giants, we believe
                operators have an opportunity to leverage the same principles
                they employ. To do so, they need to be willing to change their
                approach. In return they will significantly lower cost and
                complexity, and be radically more innovative.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is the hard problem we want to solve: At Working Group Two,
                we're building a technology platform and a company culture
                capable of disrupting the telecom industry - by making
                connectivity programmable, accessible and affordable.
              </p>

              <p>
                Joining us, you will get a lot of freedom and responsibility to
                create a big impact in the telco industry. You will be
                surrounded by friendly colleagues with deep expertise. We have a
                culture of transparency and openness, and oftentimes we call
                ourselves a “start-up for grown-ups”. It's not about being young
                or old, it's about knowing where we are going, and trusting each
                other. We want to co-create the path to get there.
              </p>

              <p>
                You will be part of a distributed team with main offices in
                Oslo, Trondheim and Stockholm as well as many remote colleagues
                in other locations. We believe in doing things together and that
                is why we frequently host company wide activities like tech
                talks, demos, and Failure Fridays. We also make sure everyone
                can get together at an offsite multiple times a year to have
                fun, discuss important topics and hack on crazy projects.
