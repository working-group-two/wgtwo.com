# Voicemail

Voicemail service is a telecommunications feature that allows callers to leave voice messages when the person they are calling is unavailable or does not answer the phone. When a caller reaches a voicemail system, they are prompted to leave a message that is recorded and stored by the system. The intended recipient of the message can then retrieve it at a later time by calling into the voicemail system and entering a personal identification number (PIN) or password. Voicemail service is commonly used in both landline and mobile phone networks and is a convenient way for people to leave messages when they are unable to reach someone directly.
