# Radius

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a protocol used for providing centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use network resources. RADIUS is commonly used in enterprise networks and internet service provider (ISP) environments to manage user access to network resources.
