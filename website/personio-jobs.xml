                                <p>We consist of driven engineers with a range of backgrounds – from global giants to small startups. Our team members work at all levels of our stack and have a large set of skills. Our company tech stack encompasses a wide variety of “cloud-native” tools and frameworks, including Kubernetes, Java, Kotlin, Go, Bazel, Envoy, AWS, and Terraform.  But if we can’t find the right tools, we build them!</p><br><p>The Infrastructure team at Working Group Two builds, maintains and runs the tools that support the engineering efforts of the rest of the company.  While many companies take infrastructure for granted, WG2 realizes that the infrastructure work we do is vital for our platform and is a big lever that enables security, speed, agility and scale in the other teams.  Because Working Group Two realizes that good infrastructure is a competitive advantage, we have the freedom to take a proactive approach and can plan longer-term and bigger tasks rather than only reacting to immediate needs.</p><br><p>We are now looking for an <strong>experienced infrastructure/software engineer</strong> with knowledge of cloud-based systems to join us and be part of our team building scalable infrastructure.  We believe you have experience with at least some of the following: </p><ul><li><p>Writing distributed, well-designed services and you know what it means to ship high-quality code. </p></li><li><p>Building infrastructure to scale up and out. </p></li><li><p>Managing container-based workloads, using Kubernetes or other orchestration software. </p></li><li><p>AWS, or other cloud infrastructure providers. </p></li><li><p>Site-reliability engineering </p></li></ul><br><p>It is beneficial if you have experience managing, operating and upgrading multiple Kubernetes clusters in a safe and reliable manner.  Knowledge of networks in a Kubernetes environment is a plus.</p><br><h3>What will you do</h3><br><p>We work to make the business work; creating the frameworks, capabilities, and tools needed to welcome millions of users globally. The infrastructure team is responsible for the setup and management of our AWS accounts and Kubernetes clusters, running internal services, and building internal tools when we can't find something to meet our needs.</p><br><p>Our team may work on our Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD system, build dashboards and create alerts out of metrics, develop needed tools or help teams tune and secure their services.  We also help ensure services that need more esoteric protocols such as SCTP, RTP and DIAMETER function in a cloud environment.  WG2 follows the tenets of modern cloud infrastructure - we build and deploy our production systems in an immutable manner, from code. We believe in thorough metrics, monitoring, and alerting. We feel that our teams should own their services, but we in the infrastructure team should provide powerful tools to enable this.</p><br>

People with a subscription from a Working Group Two powered mobile operator will soon enjoy a much richer set of features, and will be able to personalize their subscription by enabling products from our product marketplace. We will make this happen by enabling third party developers to create products that people love, and by helping operators distribute these products to their subscribers.</p><p>Our goal is to create a product ecosystem, which consists of three main components:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A developer portal:</strong> Enabling developers to use APIs and media streams for Messaging, Data, and Voice, and to submit their product to our marketplace. </p></li><li><p><strong>An operator marketplace:</strong> Allowing mobile operators to buy, manage, and distribute products to their subscribers.</p></li><li><p><strong>A subscriber marketplace:</strong> Letting mobile subscribers find, activate and launch the products they want to add to their subscription.</p></li></ul><br><p><strong>THE POSITION</strong></p><p>We’re looking for a fullstack developer preferably with product experience, to help us build our Developer Portal. The Developer Portal team currently consists of two other fullstack developers, a designer, a UX researcher, and a product owner. Your main responsibilities will be writing code and sparring with your coworkers. One of our current fullstack developers has a preference for frontend, so it would be good if you have a preference for backend.</p><p>Most of our projects use this stack:</p><pre>Figma

SQL ───────╝
K8S
AWS</pre>You don’t have to know everything from Vuetify to SQL. Maybe you’ve worked with React instead of Vue, maybe you’re <br>familiar with Tomcat but not Jetty? Picking up Kotlin should be doable if you know Java or C#. It’s not expected that you <br>know our entire stack before you join, as long as you’re willing to learn (the stack might also change). <br>We do, however, expect you to have some web backend and database experience, and we expect you to work hard to <br>familiarize yourself with our stack and our projects.

                                As new license free spectrum is becoming available, there are a lot of new use cases that are opening up in the world and we are especially seeing an increase in the 5G, IoT and private network space.<br>We, of course, also want to cater our programmable network for these new and exciting use cases and we are currently actively exploring this area.<br>This means that we are also looking for more people to join our explorations. We are now looking to welcome an experienced <strong>software engineer</strong> to join us and continue to develop our platform with new key features.<br><br>Most of our components are in-house developed in Java/Kotlin, Go, or Erlang, and are deployed on our self-managed Kubernetes cluster running on AWS. We are however language agnostic and believe in using the right tool for the job.<br>We are firmly rooted in having people own their own work. This means that you are allowed a lot of freedom when it comes to planning and which features to build. However, our engineers who develop the code are also responsible for operating the code once in production. We adhere to principles that include the use of continuous integration, continuous delivery, microservices and infrastructure as code.<br><br>We believe you have experience with:<br><ul><li>Writing distributed, well designed services in any of the languages C, C++, Go, Erlang or Java/Kotlin </li><li>Building large scalable solutions. </li><li>Caring about and shipping quality code.</li><li>Scalable cloud services (AWS, or other cloud infrastructure providers). </li><li>Prior telco industry experience is not required. </li></ul>The role is based in either of our offices in Stockholm, Oslo or Trondheim.

                                We’re a challenger in a well established multi-billion dollar industry. To succeed as a company, we need to deliver the high quality core services that subscribers are used to, while also adding value through the way that we operate. We believe our people and our culture will be a key differentiator in achieving this.<br><br>If you join us, you’ll get the trust and freedom needed to make a big impact in the telco industry. Since we’re solving telco problems in a modern way, we recruit from various industries and have people that used to work at Telenor, Google, Microsoft, and AWS. We promise that you’ll be surrounded by friendly, motivated and highly skilled coworkers. We have a culture of transparency and openness, and oftentimes we call ourselves a “start-up for grown-ups”. We know where we’re going, and with a lot of trust in each other, we’ll pave the way there together.<br><br>We’re a distributed company with offices in Oslo, Trondheim and Stockholm, a hub in Germany, as well as some remote colleagues in other locations (a total of 8 countries). We’ll pay for your phone and internet, as well as your lunch and office snacks. The Covid-19 pandemic forced a lot of companies to change how they think, but for us it confirmed that our remote-friendly and transparent approach goes a long way. We frequently host company wide activities online, like tech talks, demos, and failure fridays. This year we’ve replaced our quarterly offsites with online HackDays. We also have Monday-kick offs, virtual lunches and fikas, and online gaming groups to keep the workday fun.
