                                Up until now, all mobile subscriptions have been exactly the same, but we are changing this. Those with a subscription from a Working Group Two powered mobile operator will soon enjoy a much richer set of features, and will be able to personalize their subscription by enabling products from a marketplace. We will make this happen by letting developers create products that people love, and by helping operators distribute these products to their subscribers.<br><br>We are creating a product ecosystem, which is a multi-sided marketplace platform. Our solution consists of three main components:<br><br><ul><li>Developer Portal: Enabling developers to use APIs and media streams for Messaging, Data, and Voice, and to submit their product to our marketplace. </li><li>Partner Console: Allowing mobile operators to buy, manage, and distribute products to their subscribers.</li><li>Storefront: Letting mobile subscribers find, activate and launch the products they want to add to their subscription.</li></ul><br>THE POSITION<br>You’re not afraid to get your hands dirty! You will be making both public and internal APIs, backend services, as well as architectural decisions. You will also help set up and maintain the required infrastructure for our projects. You won’t be alone though, we already have a team member who is responsible for these exact things, so you will get a lot of help easing into the role.<br><br>At Working Group Two we don’t have a dedicated operations team, so parts of what you will be doing may be described as a devops job. All our services run in Kubernetes hosted at AWS, so you won’t need to touch actual hardware. We don’t expect you to be a Kubernetes expert, as long as you’re interested and  willing to learn.<br><br><br>We’re a relatively small team where team members are expected to raise their opinion and make decisions, so you will make a real impact on the direction we’re going.<br><br>Most of our projects use this stack:<br><br><pre>
Sketch
Buefy
Vue
REST ─────╗
gRPC      ║
Javalin   ║
Jetty     ║
Kotlin    ║
JOOQ      ║─── This position
OpenID    ║
Envoy     ║
NATS      ║
K8S       ║
AWS ──────╝</pre><br><br><br>You don’t have to know everything from REST to AWS. Maybe you’ve worked with Spring or Jersey instead of Javalin, maybe you’re familiar with Tomcat but not Jetty? Picking up Kotlin should be doable if you know Java or C#. It’s not expected that you know our entire stack before you join, as long as you’re willing to learn (the stack might also change). We do, however, expect you to have worked with AWS before, and that you have at least five years of experience working with backend/cloud services.<br><br>THE PRODUCT TEAM<br>The product team will soon consist of eight engineers, one product designer, one UX researcher, and one product manager. We’re a remote-friendly and distributed team with most members located in Trondheim, Norway. All current members are within one hour of the CET timezone. We do daily morning standups, retros every other week, and backlog grooming when necessary. And that’s it. We’re open to adjusting the way we work if you have any suggestions that you think could make it better.

                                <p>We consist of driven engineers with a range of backgrounds – from global giants to small startups. Our team members work at all levels of our stack and have a large set of skills. Our company tech stack encompasses a wide variety of “cloud-native” tools and frameworks, including Kubernetes, Java, Kotlin, Go, Bazel, Envoy, AWS, and Terraform.  But if we can’t find the right tools, we build them!</p><br><p>The Infrastructure team at Working Group Two builds, maintains and runs the tools that support the engineering efforts of the rest of the company.  While many companies take infrastructure for granted, WG2 realizes that the infrastructure work we do is vital for our platform and is a big lever that enables security, speed, agility and scale in the other teams.  Because Working Group Two realizes that good infrastructure is a competitive advantage, we have the freedom to take a proactive approach and can plan longer-term and bigger tasks rather than only reacting to immediate needs.</p><br><p>We are now looking for an <strong>experienced infrastructure/software engineer</strong> with knowledge of cloud-based systems to join us and be part of our team building scalable infrastructure.  We believe you have experience with at least some of the following: </p><ul><li><p>Writing distributed, well-designed services and you know what it means to ship high-quality code. </p></li><li><p>Building infrastructure to scale up and out. </p></li><li><p>Managing container-based workloads, using Kubernetes or other orchestration software. </p></li><li><p>AWS, or other cloud infrastructure providers. </p></li><li><p>Site-reliability engineering </p></li></ul><br><p>It is beneficial if you have experience managing, operating and upgrading multiple Kubernetes clusters in a safe and reliable manner.  Knowledge of networks in a Kubernetes environment is a plus.</p><br><h3>What will you do</h3><br><p>We work to make the business work; creating the frameworks, capabilities, and tools needed to welcome millions of users globally. The infrastructure team is responsible for the setup and management of our AWS accounts and Kubernetes clusters, running internal services, and building internal tools when we can't find something to meet our needs.</p><br><p>Our team may work on our Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD system, build dashboards and create alerts out of metrics, develop needed tools or help teams tune and secure their services.  We also help ensure services that need more esoteric protocols such as SCTP, RTP and DIAMETER function in a cloud environment.  WG2 follows the tenets of modern cloud infrastructure - we build and deploy our production systems in an immutable manner, from code. We believe in thorough metrics, monitoring, and alerting. We feel that our teams should own their services, but we in the infrastructure team should provide powerful tools to enable this.</p><br>

                                Who will you join at WG2?<br><br>You will become a part of the integrators team which consists of software and telco engineers, a solution architect and soon tech support engineer. One of your teammates will be Jessica, and this is why she thinks you should join us:<br><br>If you are anything like me, a person who wants to work in a high-paced environment with ambitious and skilled people, you will fit right in here. For me it has been valuable to have so many colleagues to look up to and learn from as that has given me what I believe to be the best conditions for rapid growth. The key is to have a curious and open-to-learn mindset - if you do you will have no problem growing here. The role you take in this company is often shaped according to your interests and skills. In my case, I wanted to be more involved with the customers and follow their journey onto our platform, as well as making sure they are satisfied once migration is done. That led me to the Integrators team. Coordinating and collaborating with the development teams on behalf of our customers is one of the main responsibilities of our team as we want to deliver the best experience of our platform. That's where you'll play a key role!<br><br>Though playing such an important role may seem daunting, you will have the whole team around to support you and help you learn about our system while solving issues. In our team we want everyone to feel productive, meaning we want everyone to learn and share knowledge. We also continuously evaluate our processes to cut parts where we don't see any value so we can focus on our core activities. Besides that, we are very keen on meeting up on any location of our team members to get to work together and have fun (post-covid of course). During covid, we have focused on having weekly tech-talks where we discuss and share knowledge on the projects we work on. We have also started having weekly AWs/fikas where we can chat about anything to get some social time as well, which has proven to be even more valuable than we expected. Our team has many exciting opportunities and projects coming up, so if you are looking to join the fun with us - apply!<br><br>What’s next?<br><br>If you’re interested in working with us please apply through the link below, or contact Marietta for any questions on marietta@wgtwo.com. We’re looking forward to getting to know you!

                                As new license free spectrum is becoming available, there are a lot of new use cases that are opening up in the world and we are especially seeing an increase in the 5G, IoT and private network space.<br>We, of course, also want to cater our programmable network for these new and exciting use cases and we are currently actively exploring this area.<br>This means that we are also looking for more people to join our explorations. We are now looking to welcome an experienced <strong>software engineer</strong> to join us and continue to develop our platform with new key features.<br><br>Most of our components are in-house developed in Java/Kotlin, Go, or Erlang, and are deployed on our self-managed Kubernetes cluster running on AWS. We are however language agnostic and believe in using the right tool for the job.<br>We are firmly rooted in having people own their own work. This means that you are allowed a lot of freedom when it comes to planning and which features to build. However, our engineers who develop the code are also responsible for operating the code once in production. We adhere to principles that include the use of continuous integration, continuous delivery, microservices and infrastructure as code.<br><br>We believe you have experience with:<br><ul><li>Writing distributed, well designed services in any of the languages C, C++, Go, Erlang or Java/Kotlin </li><li>Building large scalable solutions. </li><li>Caring about and shipping quality code.</li><li>Scalable cloud services (AWS, or other cloud infrastructure providers). </li><li>Prior telco industry experience is not required. </li></ul>The role is based in either of our offices in Stockholm, Oslo or Trondheim.

                                We’re a challenger in a well established multi-billion dollar industry. To succeed as a company, we need to deliver the high quality core services that subscribers are used to, while also adding value through the way that we operate. We believe our people and our culture will be a key differentiator in achieving this.<br><br>If you join us, you’ll get the trust and freedom needed to make a big impact in the telco industry. Since we’re solving telco problems in a modern way, we recruit from various industries and have people that used to work at Telenor, Google, Microsoft, and AWS. We promise that you’ll be surrounded by friendly, motivated and highly skilled coworkers. We have a culture of transparency and openness, and oftentimes we call ourselves a “start-up for grown-ups”. We know where we’re going, and with a lot of trust in each other, we’ll pave the way there together.<br><br>We’re a distributed company with offices in Oslo, Trondheim and Stockholm, a hub in Germany, as well as some remote colleagues in other locations (a total of 8 countries). We’ll pay for your phone and internet, as well as your lunch and office snacks. The Covid-19 pandemic forced a lot of companies to change how they think, but for us it confirmed that our remote-friendly and transparent approach goes a long way. We frequently host company wide activities online, like tech talks, demos, and failure fridays. This year we’ve replaced our quarterly offsites with online HackDays. We also have Monday-kick offs, virtual lunches and fikas, and online gaming groups to keep the workday fun.
