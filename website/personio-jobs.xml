                                <p>We consist of driven engineers with a range of backgrounds – from global giants to small startups. Our team members work at all levels of our stack and have a large set of skills. Our company tech stack encompasses a wide variety of “cloud-native” tools and frameworks, including Kubernetes, Java, Kotlin, Go, Bazel, Envoy, AWS, and Terraform.  But if we can’t find the right tools, we build them!</p><br><p>The Infrastructure team at Working Group Two builds, maintains and runs the tools that support the engineering efforts of the rest of the company.  While many companies take infrastructure for granted, WG2 realizes that the infrastructure work we do is vital for our platform and is a big lever that enables security, speed, agility and scale in the other teams.  Because Working Group Two realizes that good infrastructure is a competitive advantage, we have the freedom to take a proactive approach and can plan longer-term and bigger tasks rather than only reacting to immediate needs.</p><br><p>We are now looking for an <strong>experienced infrastructure/software engineer</strong> with knowledge of cloud-based systems to join us and be part of our team building scalable infrastructure.  We believe you have experience with at least some of the following: </p><ul><li><p>Writing distributed, well-designed services and you know what it means to ship high-quality code. </p></li><li><p>Building infrastructure to scale up and out. </p></li><li><p>Managing container-based workloads, using Kubernetes or other orchestration software. </p></li><li><p>AWS, or other cloud infrastructure providers. </p></li><li><p>Site-reliability engineering </p></li></ul><br><p>It is beneficial if you have experience managing, operating and upgrading multiple Kubernetes clusters in a safe and reliable manner.  Knowledge of networks in a Kubernetes environment is a plus.</p><br><h3>What will you do</h3><br><p>We work to make the business work; creating the frameworks, capabilities, and tools needed to welcome millions of users globally. The infrastructure team is responsible for the setup and management of our AWS accounts and Kubernetes clusters, running internal services, and building internal tools when we can't find something to meet our needs.</p><br><p>Our team may work on our Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD system, build dashboards and create alerts out of metrics, develop needed tools or help teams tune and secure their services.  We also help ensure services that need more esoteric protocols such as SCTP, RTP and DIAMETER function in a cloud environment.  WG2 follows the tenets of modern cloud infrastructure - we build and deploy our production systems in an immutable manner, from code. We believe in thorough metrics, monitoring, and alerting. We feel that our teams should own their services, but we in the infrastructure team should provide powerful tools to enable this.</p><br>

Those with a subscription from a WG2 powered mobile operator will soon enjoy a much richer set of features, and will be able to personalize their subscription with products from a marketplace. We will make this happen by letting developers create products that people love, and by helping operators distribute these products to their subscribers.<br><br>In other words, we are creating a product ecosystem, similar to the Apple Appstore and Google Play Store, but the apps in our ecosystem live in the cloud and act upon the mobile subscriptions themselves, rather than live and act on the phone that the subscription uses.</p><br><p><strong>THE POSITION</strong></p><p>We want to build a Customer Portal. We’re setting up a new team for this purpose, and we’re looking for a full-stack developer who has experience with working on products to join this team. Since the Customer Portal has not been developed yet, you will have the opportunity to be involved from the very start, in a product that plays a critical role in the company.</p><p>Most of our day to day work involves the following technology: Vuetify, Vue, Rest, gRPC, Javalin, Jetty, Kotlin, jOOQ, OpenID, Envoy, NATS, K8S, and AWS. You don’t have to know everything from REST to AWS. Maybe you’ve worked with Spring or Jersey instead of Javalin, maybe you’re familiar with Tomcat but not Jetty? Picking up Kotlin should be doable if you know Java or C#. It’s not expected that you know our entire stack before you join, as long as you’re willing to learn (the stack might also change).

                                <h4><br></h4><h4><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The product and the position:</span></h4><p>In this position you will own and manage the <a href="https://developer.wgtwo.com/">WG2 Developer Portal</a> and <a href="https://v1.docs.wgtwo.com/">API Docs</a>. </p><br><p>You will have two key responsibilities: Assessing product/feature opportunities and defining the product/feature to be built. As these are early stage products, it’s not about making small adjustments and tweaking something that already works well - it’s about discovery. You need to create, own and execute the strategy for how we can go from tens, to hundreds, and then thousands of 3rd party developers that find it attractive and easy to build and monetise products on our platform.</p><br><h4><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Users and customers</span></h4><p>The users of the Developer Portal and API Docs are typically in the role of Software Engineer, or Product Manager. They are usually working at independent product companies, but sometimes also in companies that are contracted  by one of our customers (telecom operators) to deliver a specific product, or in-house at the telecom operator. </p><br><p>Some context:</p><p>Working Group Two has built a cloud native core network for telecom operators, providing the functionality to manage the telecom networks and providing connectivity such as voice, messaging and data. Telecom operators that are our customers get their core network delivered as a service, instead of an on-premise solution as is the industry standard. </p><br><p>Because all our customers are subscribing to a tenancy in our cloud core network it is now possible to build a product once and ship it to all operators on our platform. If you’re working with software products in almost any other industry this will not sound like a big deal—but it is. Why? Look up any operator in any country and you will see that all of them sell a combination of data/calling/texting at a price. In contrast to this, the operators on our platform are able to compete on product differentiation. They can do this by choosing from various network applications such as anti-spam, safe surf, and much more, developed by 3rd party developers on our platform that are available through our marketplace. </p><br><p>To maximize this opportunity we have built a multi-sided marketplace platform that 1) enables developers to build products and sell them to operators, and 2) enables operators to buy the products and distribute them to their subscriber base. </p><br><h4><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Vision</span></h4><p>We believe that mobile subscriptions in the future will give a better user experience, and that subscribers will get a personalized experience by adding on the products that they would like to. The way that we are making this happen is by enabling developers to build products, and helping operators buy and distribute them. </p><br><p>No one has ever created a product ecosystem for a telecom core before. There is no existing product on the market for us to copy, there is no global standard we can follow, and certainly no blueprint we can follow step by step. </p><br><p>The good news is that we have taken the first step. We do have a developer portal, APIs that give products access to the media streams and events that go through the core network, and a marketplace where our existing and future customers can find and buy products. </p><br><p>Now we’re looking for a <strong>Product Manage</strong><strong>r</strong> with background in software development, that can take the developer experience to the next level. </p><br><h4><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Your background</span></h4><p>We don’t know for sure, but assume that someone who has worked as a software developer or tech lead on a team with a great product manager, or someone who has already transitioned into a product manager role would be a great fit. But: </p><br><p>Great Product Managers come from all walks of life, so we’re not looking for a narrowly defined education and career path, but certain personal traits, attitudes, and skills. You don’t need all of them, but we are on the lookout for people with: </p><ul><li><p>Product passion: You just love great products. </p></li><li><p>User Empathy: To build something great for someone you need to empathize with them.   </p></li><li><p>Intelligence / smarts: There is no substitute for it. You’re going to need insights and judgements. </p></li><li><p>Work ethic: The buck stops with you on your products. That requires effort and commitment. </p></li><li><p>Integrity: You will have to make tough decisions and difficult tradeoffs that affect your users, team, and company. </p></li><li><p>Confidence: You’re going to have to believe in yourself to change an industry. </p></li><li><p>Technology: You do not need to be an expert on all software. You do not need to be an expert on telecom technology. You do however need to learn/understand the relevant technologies at a functional level. </p></li><li><p>Focus: You can take the product and team in any and all directions, but to be successful you’re going to need to choose and keep focus. </p></li><li><p>Time management: You need to be skilled at quickly distinguishing between that which is important from that which is urgent, and prioritize and plan accordingly. </p></li><li><p>Communication skills: You need to be able to communicate well with the different roles in your team, in the company, and with your users. </p></li><li><p>Business skills: At the end of the day your product needs to work for our business.  </p></li></ul><br><h4><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Team and colleagues</span></h4><p>As Product Manager you will be a part of the “Ecosystem Services” product team. In addition to your role, the team has a Tech Lead, a couple of Software Engineers, a User Researcher, and a Designer. You will also work closely with and report directly to the Head of Product. </p><br>We are a remote-friendly and distributed team with most members located in Trondheim, Norway. All current members are within one hour of the CET time zone.<br><br><br><div><div><div><div><div><h4><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What’s next?</span></h4></div></div></div></div></div><p>If you’re interested in working with us, please apply through the link below, or contact Marietta for any questions on marietta@wgtwo.com.
