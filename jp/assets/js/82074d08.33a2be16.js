We are now looking to welcome an experienced&nbsp;<strong>software engineer</strong> to join us and continue to develop our platform with new key features.<br><br>Most of our components are in-house developed in Java/Kotlin, Go, or Erlang, and are deployed on our self-managed Kubernetes cluster running on AWS. We are however language agnostic and believe in using the right tool for the job.<br>We are firmly rooted in having people own their own work. This means that you are allowed a lot of freedom when it comes to planning and which features to build. However, our engineers who develop the code are also responsible for operating the code once in production.

To succeed as a company, we need to deliver the high quality core services that subscribers are used to, while also adding value through the way that we operate. We believe our people and our culture will be a key differentiator in achieving this.<br><br>If you join us, you\u2019ll get the trust and freedom needed to make a big impact in the telco industry.

We promise that you\u2019ll be surrounded by friendly, motivated and highly skilled coworkers. We have a culture of transparency and openness, and oftentimes we call ourselves a \u201cstart-up for grown-ups\u201d.

We\u2019ll pay for your phone and internet, as well as your lunch and office snacks. The Covid-19 pandemic forced a lot of companies to change how they think, but for us it confirmed that our remote-friendly and transparent approach goes a long way. We frequently host company wide activities online, like tech talks, demos, and failure fridays. This year we\u2019ve replaced our quarterly offsites with online HackDays. We also have Monday-kick offs, virtual lunches and fikas, and online gaming groups to keep the workday fun.\\n\\n                            </value>\\n                        "]}')}}]);
