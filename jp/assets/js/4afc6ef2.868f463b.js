The Covid-19 pandemic forced a lot of companies to change how they think, but for us it confirmed that our remote-friendly and transparent approach goes a long way. We frequently host company wide activities online, like tech talks or demos. We organise company-wide offsites and team meet-ups. We also have Monday-kick offs, virtual lunches and fikas, and online gaming groups to keep the workday fun.\\n\\n                            </value>\\n                        "]}]')}}]);
