Telecom operators that are our customers get their core network delivered as a service, instead of an on-premise solution as is the industry standard.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Because all our customers are subscribing to a tenancy in our cloud core network it is now possible to build a product once and ship it to all operators on our platform.

Look up any operator in any country and you will see that all of them sell a combination of data/calling/texting at a price. In contrast to this, the operators on our platform are able to compete on product differentiation. They can do this by choosing from various network applications such as anti-spam, safe surf, and much more, developed by 3rd party developers on our platform that are available through our marketplace.&nbsp;</p><br><p>To maximize this opportunity we have built a multi-sided marketplace platform that 1) enables developers to build products and sell them to operators, and 2) enables operators to buy the products and distribute them to their subscriber base.&nbsp;</p><br><h4><span style=\\"font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\\">Vision</span></h4><p>We believe that mobile subscriptions in the future will give a better user experience, and that subscribers will get a personalized experience by adding on the products that they would like to.
