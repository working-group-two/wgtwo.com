Mobile virtual operators of every kind face similar challenges. It is hard and expensive to build and operate your own core, and even harder to get a competitive advantage from it. A better way is now possible.

:::tip innovation
At **wgtwo** we believe MVNxs need modern networks that evolve with customer needs, scale up with user growth, and supply the next generation of technology. We believe **affordability**, **simplicity** and providing operators with an **ability to differentiate** themselves is how we create a successful partnership.

Operators can join a running platform where the core network is distilled down to easy-to-use APIs. Reducing cost and complexity, the platform allows MVNxs to leverage a product ecosystem to create real differentiation in the marketplace.

Wouldnâ€™t it be great to get out of survival mode, and instead leverage the mobile core for the strategic asset it can be?

A unique approach to building and operating the core to be programmable, flexible and operated as-a-service gives MVNxs real power of differentiation.
