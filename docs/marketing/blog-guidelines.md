WG2 
**Content and blogging guidelines** 
Updated March 21, 2022

**Why do we have a blog?**
Contribute to the industry dialogue and share our knowledge - to build trust in our company and people
Build visibility for our company towards customers, talents and third party developers - in line with our brand platform
Create inbound traffic to our website with the aim to convert relevant visitors into customers, third party developers  or job applicants

**Why do we need a guideline for content and blogging?** 
To stimulate positive, constructive, high-quality and collaboration-oriented posts that make our values come alive. The guidelines are meant to protect us as employees and the brand as the employer. 

**Guidelines**
1. Make it a team effort
- Be respectful and acknowledge the contributions from colleagues, customers and partners. This doesn’t mean we can’t have opinions! 
- Conflicts are internal - unless we deliberately want to share a problem we had and how we solved it.

2. Add real value
- Think about who you’re talking to and how you add to the conversation.
- Steal with pride, but respect copyrights and other legal constraints. 
- Be mindful about stuff like financial info, customer data, strategies, upcoming feature/products, religion, politics, and sexual references.

3. Get reviewed and get help
- Just like our software updates are peer-reviewed for quality, so must content and blog posts. 
- The marketing function is ultimately responsible for our external communications and is here to help with language, angles and general QA - as well as being the brand police to enforce all of the above.
