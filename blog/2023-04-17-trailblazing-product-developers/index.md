### **OnRelay - mobile switchboard**

[OnRelay](https://www.onrelay.com/) is building a world-class, software-based **PBX** (mobile switchboard), available to all operators on WG2's platform. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYrVzKNpntQ), Marie Wold talks about who their dream customer is, and more.

### **ElitNet - voice anti-spam**

Fake calls and voice spam are a major nuisance for both operators and their customers. The clever folks at [Elitnet](https://elitnet.eu/), a product company with more than 25 years of experience, have created a product to protect the network and its subscribers from unwanted calls. **Voice Anti-spam** is available to operators on the WG2 platform.

### **Voxist - virtual personal assistant**

The idea of the team behind [Voxist](https://www.voxist.com/) is to create a **virtual personal assistant** that replaces old voicemail systems. People calling get personalized greetings, and a message can be transcribed and sent as a text message. A Voxist user can access voicemail messages through the web or app interface - or via email when away from the phone. Find it on WG2's platform.

### **Vxt - smart voicemail**

The passionate [Vxt](https://www.vxt.co.nz/) team is on a mission to leverage communications data to automate the most boring work in the world, namely administrative tasks. They’ve made **voicemail** both simpler and smarter by offering instant transcriptions, smart greetings, email integration, and the ability to access your messages from anywhere.

### **Product distribution opportunity** 

One of our operator customers, with multi-country ambitions, is looking for products to differentiate and drive new revenue streams. Here are the product categories they specifically look for:  
  
- 🔒 **Online content filtering:** Help people avoid harm and danger while surfing, by blocking certain online content.  
- 📍 **Location tracking:** Help people know where their loved ones are without depending on battery draining apps who sell their data to advertisers.  
- 👮🏾 **Individual Network Management:** Give people a more private, quick, secure, and stable internet experience by letting them set their own VPN, Static IP, and DNS.  
- 📪 **SMS in messaging apps:** Let people use their favorite messaging app for all texting by getting SMSes in there too.
