However we have a
few cases where we need to do some additional work.</p><p>One case for example is that we have to use static IPs for some of our services to connect to
Telecom companies as they expect a single IP address to bind to. This address needs to be fixed and
DNS records are not accepted either. We are running in AWS as well, so the reader might ask why are we not
using Elastic IPs and adding them to the services? Good idea, but Telecom operators will not whitelist
an Elastic IP for you as there are no guarantees that it will belong to your company infrastructure forever. There
are also additional challenges when it comes to using Elastic IP in private subnet over VPN or direct connect.</p><p>We are a member of RIPE and do have a small subnet block for our own use, so we thought we could make use of
that. As we own the block and AWS supports BYOIP (Bring your own IP-range), we created a special subnet with
some Kubernetes nodes in it. This was not enough to make this work since we depended on a service always having
the same IP attached to it, as well as the node running a pod having some very specific Routes set.</p><p>With this scenario in mind we set out to find solutions and all solutions we could think of required haggling
with Kubernetes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="extending-kubernetes">Extending Kubernetes<a class="hash-link" href="#extending-kubernetes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>There are several ways to extend Kubernetes. All functionality in Kubernetes is build upon very nice and clean
public APIs, or to say it with other words: There is no private API magic hidden somewhere. So lets look at
two ways on how to extend Kubernetes.</p><p>Possible ways to go forward:</p><ul><li>Adding a scheduler extender</li><li>Creating an operator/controller</li></ul><p>There are more ways to extend Kubernetes, but these two ways will be the one we shall look at. Just for completeness
you can as well also add another scheduler or change Kubernetes itself. However these possibilities have some serious
downsides.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="adding-a-scheduler-extender">Adding a scheduler extender<a class="hash-link" href="#adding-a-scheduler-extender" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The Kubernetes scheduler checks for certain requirements before it schedules a pod onto a node. Some of these requirements
are hard requirements, like cpu, memory and number of pods. Other requirements are more soft, like if the pods are allowed to
be packed together or in which AZ they are going to run. All of those requirements are collected and points given to each
node on how well they meet the requirements. The node that fits best, gets chosen.</p><p>All of these are things the scheduler will do for you automatically, however it is also possible to give the cluster a
<code>KubeSchedulerConfiguration</code> object that will tell the scheduler to also reach out to a service for additional point scoring.
The SchedulerConfiguration is a JSON file and for further explanations, please have a look at this
excellent <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/articles/creating-a-custom-kube-scheduler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>.</p><p>In our case, we could have written a service that checks which IP Addresses are assigned to the Nodes and moved the Pods
onto those nodes. This would have required us to make sure that those nodes had all needed IP-Addresses all the time.
That sounded not very enticing when doing cluster upgrades as it would have needed to be at least a semi-manual process.
So we decided against this approach.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="creating-an-operator">Creating an operator<a class="hash-link" href="#creating-an-operator" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>An Operator/Controller on the other hand is a component observing resources and then try to create the declared resources.
The difference between a controller and an operator is basically that an operator is handling the lifecycle of an
application, whereas a controller may control specific resources that are not associated with a specific application.
They both use the controller pattern though and both can be implemented with the same toolset, so for simplicity sake in the
context of this article, we will consider them to be equal.</p><p>Operators usually consists at least out of a <strong><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRD(CustomResourceDefinition)</a></strong>, an <strong>event listener</strong> and a <strong>reconciliation loop</strong>.
The <em>CRD</em> basically creates a new type of resource and effectively implements a domain specific language for the operator. The whole description on what this deployment
needs to look like and all its abilities need to be defined in the <em>CRD</em>. The operator will create an <em>event listener</em> for that
<em>CRD</em> as the primary resource and additional <em>event listeners</em> for the secondary resource (most likely pods in this example).
The <em>event listener</em> will let the <em>reconciliation loop</em> know once a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRUD</a> operation has been requested on either the primary or
secondary resource. The <em>loop</em> will then try to bring the <em>CRD</em> into the desired state, depending on what operation has been
requested. So in the Redis example it will either create the pods, update the pods, in the case of an upgrade it might blue/green
deploy the pods or delete the pods. Basically things a human operator would do in this case, just in programmatic form, taking it
from a declarative form into existing resources.</p><p>As our initial problem was making services available on static IP addresses, we chose to explore this approach further,
basically attaching additional IP addresses to the nodes running specific pods.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="building-an-operatorcontroller">Building an Operator/Controller<a class="hash-link" href="#building-an-operatorcontroller" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>For building an operator, there are several frameworks out there, but we will only look at the <a href="https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">operator-framework</a> in
this article.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="operator-sdk">Operator-SDK<a class="hash-link" href="#operator-sdk" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The Operator framework is a project that is designed to help you get started on creating an operator. To achieve that,
it will generate quite a bit of boilerplate.</p><p>The Operator-SDK supports three different models of creating an operator:</p><ul><li>Helm</li><li>Ansible</li><li>Golang</li></ul><p>Depending on your choice of tool, you will be able to integrate deeper into Kubernetes or not.</p><p><img alt="operator-sdk-capabilites" src="/assets/images/operator-capability-level-f511b5d60b3e9160a4582577204888cd.png" title="Operator sdk capabilities (Taken from the operator-sdk repo)" width="2440" height="1200">
<em><a href="https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operator sdk capabilities</a></em></p><p>As we didn&#x27;t want to be limited by our choice later on and wanted to expose metrics from our operator, we chose to
implement our operator in golang. We will be using the operator-sdk version 0.12 for this.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="what-we-want-to-do">What we want to do<a class="hash-link" href="#what-we-want-to-do" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Looking at the problem again, we need some way to make sure that a node that runs a specific pod, needs to
have an IP address attached to it. This IP address will be given to connecting parties as a entry point to our
system and thus cannot change.</p><p>Features it needs to support</p><ul><li>Reserve IP address from range</li><li>Attach IP address to node running pod</li><li>Detach IP address from node that is not running pod</li><li>Move IP addresses around in case of node failure</li></ul><p>This feature list already shows some things we will not and most likely cannot support. For example autoscaling of
replica sets will not work as an IP address is bound to a node with an assigned pod. There is
a 1-1 association here. However it is still possible to use the self-healing properties of Deployments
in this case.</p><p>When thinking about modelling this behaviour, we basically decided on the following approach:</p><ul><li>Create a IP kind (for reserving the IP Address in the Range)</li><li>Use annotations to attach the IP Address to a pod</li></ul><p>We also thought about creating a StaticIPDeployment kind, but at the end decided against it, as
we feared that the lifecycle management would be way more complicated if we needed to manage a deployment
instead of just controlling the assignment of an IP Address.</p><p>After all this is the first Operator we are going to write and didn&#x27;t want to drown in complexity from day one.
We would rather iterate and scrap everything after we tried it, then going too complex from the start.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="implementation">Implementation<a class="hash-link" href="#implementation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The first thing you do when starting off a new operator, is that you initialize the directory of your

has taught us quite a bit about how Kubernetes works and has already saved us work in the past
few months, especially on node failures.</p><p>The operator-sdk has been a great tool for us to solve this problem and we see that there is a lot of work
going into it, making it simpler to create operators. It might look intimidating at first, but is worth the effort and
we think in the future Kubernetes operators will be the way how stateful components will be managed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="resources--further-reading">Resources /
