this week we started off with a three days hackathon!

Every quarter **wgtwo** holds a three day hackday. Hackdays are a great way for everyone in the company to work together in creating new innovative solutions for every day problems.

This time, we had the joy of having a three day remote hackday that included 10+ teams and yes - *pizza*.
