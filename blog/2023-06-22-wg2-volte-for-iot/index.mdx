Telenor manages international IoT deployments for global customers in some 200 countries and today operates more than 20 million connected devices to enterprises such as Volvo, Scania, Hitachi, Verisure Securitas Direct and Husqvarna. WG2 has been selected to provide the VoLTE technology to Telenor Connexion’s subscribers, wherever in the world they have 4G network coverage only.

The gradual shutdown of legacy 2G/3G networks across the world makes VoLTE mandatory to provide voice services for critical use cases such as assistance calls for smart elevators, elderly monitoring, and car emergency/helpline calls.

WG2’s VoLTE-as-a-service has been integrated with Telenor Connexion’s internal systems, as well as to relevant service partners platforms including the Aeris IoTA (Internet of Things Accelerator), to jointly operate for subscriber network access, authentication, and services profile. It has also been integrated to handle calls outside VoLTE domain (legacy mobile circuit switching / public switched telephone network). VoLTE from WG2 is built on IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) infrastructure, which enables voice and messaging over IP.

VoLTE-as-a-service provides benefits such as reduced infrastructure investment, rapid deployment, scalability, expertise and support, continuous upgrades and innovation, geographic reach, interconnectivity, and cost optimization. 

“For us, the scalability of VoLTE is of high essence. With a cloud-based solution delivered to us as a service we find that WG2 can fulfil our global scalability needs, while also complying to our high expectations of security and availability,” says Martin Whitlock, CTO, Telenor Connexion.

“As networks rapidly evolve, so must critical voice infrastructure. We’re pleased to work with Telenor Connexion, the leading, global IoT vendor, to provide their customers with scalable and secure voice capabilities, delivered as-a-service,” says Erlend Prestgard, CEO, WG2.
