![iso badge](./iso-badge-background.png)

ISO 27001 released a new standard in 2022, succeeding their previous version from 2013, making it the newest and most comprehensive security standard that outlines [93 information security controls](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MpdbcFEmW5678L1SToJhf0UiC3mjcpSMStxbc_kDCxY/edit#gid=0) to safeguard against various risks and threats. These controls cover all aspects of information security, from policies and roles to the use of cryptography and network security. They address critical domains such as access control, authentication, secure coding, application security, vulnerability management, and incident management, to name a few. The standard also emphasizes the importance of compliance with legal, statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements, ensuring that organizations maintain an up-to-date understanding of their obligations. By adhering to these controls, Working Group Two can significantly reduce its exposure to security risks and safeguard its sensitive data and assets against unauthorized access, theft, or misuse.
