At Working Group Two we have been offering public APIs for a long time using major version zero.

They have been great for playing around getting and we have learned a lot about what we actually need. So now its time to step up our game.

We are releasing our first production ready gRPC APIs!

<!--truncate-->
Have you ever received a welcome SMS when toggling flight mode off as you were on your way out of a plane starting off your awesome vacation? In this blog post we will describe our approach to supporting that vacation-feeling SMS, and how we transitioned using gRPC streams to support it and greatly improve the flexibility of our platform. 

As a quick first version, we have implemented a service that listens to location update events happening in our core and decides whether a user has changed a country or not according to our records of your previous and new location. If a user did change a country we would fire a simple POST request to a configured endpoint hosted by the operator with this information. This has for most parts been good enough to get the job done, but creates an explicit dependency between our core and our partner operator service being up and responsive which makes the solution prone to errors and make the system less flexible. 

At Working Group Two we are relying heavily on gRPC APIs, and are now ready to officially release our first gRPC API after playing around with our v0 APIs for a long time.

To get notifications of a phone attaching to a network in another country, you may use our `StreamCountryChangeEvents` API.

By calling this API, you initiate a server stream where you will receive this type of event for your customers. The API requires that you send an acknowledgement message when you have successfully processed the event, for which failing to do so will make it resend after a given timeout.

You may control load for your clients by setting how many concurrent events should be in-flight, and you may create multiple connections to share load between your servers.  This gives both us and the users of our API greater flexibility in consuming events that happen in the core of our network and gives them the freedom to react in a way they believe is best for their user base. This is true for all the event-type server streams we offer.

All in all, we feel that moving to gRPC, where we give the client flexibility in how these events should be consumed and where we protect the client from high load is the right move, instead of spending energy in adding resending and failure handling of our previous solution.

### The APIs


Our first batch of gRPC APIs consists of a list of APIs listed below.

All our event-based APIs have a common metadata field which contains the subscriber identifier (using Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier) and the identifier used for acknowledging the messages. For brevity this is not included in the below examples.


#### StreamCountryChangeEvents

This one is explained in the intro section, and will let you listen to a stream of events for when the SIM first attaches to a network in another country.

##### Example
```json
{
  "metadata": { ... },
  "countryChangeEvent": {
    "previous": {
      "code": "NO",
      "name": "Norway"
    },
    "current": {
      "code": "SE",
      "name": "Sweden"
    }
  }
}
```

#### StreamHandsetChangeEvents

This lets you listen to a stream of events for when a SIM attaches via a new handset. This can typically be used for sending you new APN settings as you set up your new phone.

##### Example
```json
{
  "metadata": { ... },
  "handsetChangeEvent": {
    "previous": {
      "imeiSv": {
        "imei": "86700000000000",
        "softwareVersion": "64"
      }
    },
    "current": {
      "imeiSv": {
        "imei": "86700000000001",
        "softwareVersion": "65"
      }
    },
    "imsi": {
      "value": "(...)"
    }
  }
}
```

#### StreamFirstAttachmentEvents

This lets you listen to a stream of events for when the SIM attaches to the network for the first time. In other words, it may give an operator a simple way to see that a SIM has been taken in use.

##### Example
```json
{
  "metadata": { ... },
  "firstAttachmentEvent": {
    "number": {
      "e164": "+47xxxxxxxx",
    },
    "imsi": {
      "value": "24206000010001"
    }
  }
}
```

#### StreamPeriodicCountryEvents

This API has some familiarities to the StreamCountryChangeEvents API. It will periodically send events related to the country a SIM card is located at.

This may be used if you want some message to be sent out when a user has a longer stay in another country and you want to ensure the user has the required information about roaming prices.

##### Example
```json
{
  "metadata": { ... },
  "periodicCountryEvent": {
    "number": {
      "e164": "+4799990000"
    },
    "imsi": {
      "value": "242010000000000"
    },
    "country": {
      "code": "SE",
      "name": "Sweden"
    }
  }
}
```

#### SMS APIs

We have also launched three SMS APIs, which will be covered more in depth later.


##### Send text SMS from subscriber

This allows you to send text SMSes from a subscriber to any phone number.


##### Send text SMS to subscriber

This allows a service to send text SMSes to a subscriber from either a phone number or an alphanumeric sender ID.


##### Send data SMS to subscriber

This allows a service to send data SMSes to a subscriber from either a phone number or an alphanumeric sender ID.

This may be used to for example sending APN settings when your subscribers swap phones and such.


### Why we chose gRPC

Using gRPC, our published proto-files are the contract for our APIs. This makes documentation easier, and makes it easy to ensure we donâ€™t break our existing APIs.

As with the StreamCountryChangeEvents API, we have a lot of streaming APIs. In our experience gRPC makes implementing streams easy. We do also use protobufs a lot internally, and have found that  it helps us implement changes in a non-breaking way and has aided us in making communication work between services written in different languages work without too much hassle.


### Our API playground

A lot of our APIs are still in v0. The v0 APIs is our playground where we have been testing out what functionality we actually need, and how we can expose that in a way that is easy to use.

This includes APIs for receiving SMS, building WebRTC clients, setting up SIP integrations and more.

For production usage, we do recommend that you stick to our released APIs as we may make breaking changes to our v0 APIs without any notice. You are however free to use them for demo purposes, and we are happy for feedback if there is anything you need to build your next product.
