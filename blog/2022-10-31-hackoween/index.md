Just as October was about to close, we ran a hackathon, aptly named "Hackoween" ðŸŽƒ

Hackdays are a great way for everyone in the company to work together in creating new innovative solutions for everyday problems.

This time, we had the joy of having a hackday that included 15+ teams and yes - *pizza*. As with anything these days, a hackathon is a mix of virtual and physical. 

# Hackday Presentations

## Building a system overview for wgtwo

*Team: Karl Johan, Anders, Tor, Oliver, Tobias*

Building a new "Telco 102" visualization of our system architecture - used for both internal onboarding and to aid us when we talk to customers. 

## MATRIX (MAximum TRacing with mInimal Xffort)

*Team: Karl Johan*

Side-project to see what we could get out of our Java/Kotlin services by utilizing existing projects. Utilize the setup the Infrastructure team has made in dev around opentelemetry and XRay. The idea is to improve tracing across the stack. 

## Gophish - for internal anti-phishing campaign

*Team: Jonny, Gunnar Inge*

The goal of this project is to deploy Gophish and setup a phishing campaign - to develop internal resilience against phishing attacks. Check out their guide to developing internal phishing campaigns [on our blog.](https://www.wgtwo.com/blog/internal-email-phishing-campaigns/)

## Handover Machine 2000 (Hammer2000)

*Team: Holger, Sindre, Rune, Alain, Jacob*

For testing handover between 2 physical Antennas a phone needs to move between the coverage of two antennas. This has historically been done by moving a human holding a phone between two antennas. In a bright future, we want a physical contraption that will move a phone between the coverage areas of the antennas
